</h1>

<p>
This paper investigates resultative phrases in Japanese and
shows that their behaviors are more consistent with adjuncts
than with obligatorily controlled complements as proposed by
some authors. It is shown that, as expected of adjuncts,
Japanese resultative phrases iterate, and do not always take a
predetermined argument of the main verb as the semantic
subject or as the antecedent of a reflexive contained in
resultative phrases. A lexical rule account is given, which
analyzes resultative phrases as adverbials and places them on
the valence list of the main verb.
