The word order facts of radically non-configurational languages pose a challenge to HPSG
approaches which assume both that the surface order of words is the yield of the (tectogrammatical)
tree and standard HPSG-style cancellation of valence lists. These languages allow discontinuous noun
phrases, in which modifiers appear separated from their head nouns by arbitrarily many other words
from the same clause. In this paper, I explore an analysis which preserves
tectogrammatical-phenogrammatical equivalence, and accounts for the word order facts of Wambaya with
an analysis based on non-cancellation. This analysis is contrasted with other approaches to
discontinuous constituents and analyses of other phenomena based on non-cancellation. Finally, I
explore the implications for current models of semantic compositionality.

This paper examines the syntactic behaviour of two omnisyndetic coordinations (also called
correlative coordinations), i.e. the disjunctive and the conjunctive types in Romanian, by
explaining its data in a Romance perspective. Major issue has been whether these structures have
symmetric or asymmetric structures. If all these Romance languages share a symmetric analysis for
the disjunctive type Conj ... Conj, it is not the case for the conjunctive type. Our aim is to show that
the postulation of a conjunctional status for the Romanian structure şi ... şi ('both ... and'), which is
the most widespread view in Romanian grammars, is inadequate for the Romanian data.

In this paper we address the question of which transitive verbs
allow there-insertion in Danish. We propose that two constraints
have to be met in order for verbs to appear in Danish
there-constructions. Firstly, as have been noted by others, an empty
direct object position must be available. This constraint is not
sufficient for restricting the set of verbs in there-constructions.
We further propose a <q>locative</q> constraint. The transitive verbs allowing
there-insertion will be shown to coincide with verbs that allow a
locative analysis.

Drellishak, Scott # mailed # University of Washington # Complex case phenomena in the Grammar Matrix # 2008-10-16 # #
This paper describes a number of verbal argument marking patterns found in the world's languages and
provides HPSG analyses for them.  In addition to commonly-occurring variations of morphosyntactic
alignment (e.g. nominative-accusative, ergative-absolutive), this paper also presents analyses of
more complex phenomena, including ergativity splits, Austronesian-style focus-case systems, and
direct-inverse systems and their interaction with case.

Flickinger, Dan # 0000-0001-7959-999X # CSLI, Stanford University # Transparent heads # 2008-10-29 # #
Head-complement structures in HPSG identify most properties of the phrase with those of the head
daughter, except for that valence property (e.g. SUBCAT or COMPS) whose constraints are met by the
non-head daughter(s) in the phrase.  In this paper I present several phenomena in English syntax
where idiosyncratic properties of a non-head daughter in a phrase must remain visible on the phrasal
node, in order to preserve the strong version of the principle of locality in subcategorization. I
propose a general formal mechanism to effect this occasional transparency of heads with respect to
certain properties of their complements.

Coordination in Japanese poses various puzzles which defy the standard notion of syntactic
category. On the one hand, one can conjoin structures which one usually would not expect to form any
constituent, and on the other hand, there are various conjunction particles that are sensitive to
the kind of conjuncts that they combine with. In this paper we argue against abandoning the usual
notion of constituency, and redefining the entire grammar of Japanese. We provide a novel
construction-based account of the data in which the phenomena result from the interaction of the
coordination construction, ellipsis, and allomorphy of the conjunction particle.

Kiss, Tibor # 0000-0003-1857-3686 # Ruhr-Universität Bochum # Towards a grammar of preposition-noun combinations # 2008-10-19 # #
Preposition-noun combinations (PNCs) are compositional and
productive, but not fully regular. In school grammars and many
theoretical approaches, PNCs are neglected, but they have recently
been addressed in an HPSG analysis by Baldwin et al. (2006). After
discussing some basic properties of PNCs, we show that statistical
methods can be employed to prove that PNCs are indeed productive
and compositional, which again implies that PNCs should receive a
syntactic analysis. Such an analysis, however, is impeded by the
limited regularity of the construction. We will point out why adding
semantic conditions to syntactic schemata might be necessary but not
sufficient and turn then to a framework which allows the derivation of
syntactic (and semantic) generalizations from linguistic data without
taking recourse to introspective judgments.

Ko, Kil Soo # unknown # University Paris 7 # Korean postpositions as weak syntactic heads # 2008-10-16 # #
This paper deals with Korean postpositions. They are treated as suffixes in recent lexicalist
works. But they differ syntactically from suffixes and we will propose to treat them as clitics,
i.e. words combining with a phrase in the syntax and attaching to its last lexical item in the
phonology. We treat them as weak syntactic heads, taking into account their head properties and the
syntactic similarity between the mother phrase and the host phrase. They take the latter as
complement and share most of its syntactic properties. Revising the traditional classification, we
divide postpositions into three subtypes: marking, oblique and semantic postpositions, based on
their distributional properties, such as optionality, non-nominal marking and stacking, etc. Finally
we show how our analysis can be described in the HPSG model.

Laurens, Frédéric # mailed # Université Paris 7 # French predicative verbless utterances # 2008-10-16 #
This paper focuses on a specific type of verbless utterance, labeled PVU, which is defined by two properties: 
<ul>
<li>PVUs are not discourse fragments.</li>
<li>PVUs can host a phrase in their right periphery which is coreferential with their external argument. This phrase is labeled <q>&alpha;-phrase</q>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>PVUs are analyzed as clausal predicative phrases. Although PVUs can have various illocutionary forces, their content type is constrained by their syntactic form.</p>
<p>As for &alpha;-phrases, they are shown to be right-dislocated phrases. Right-dislocation is analyzed as a local anaphoric phenomenon. This approach is consistent with the anaphoric properties of PVUs' external arguments.

The conference talk dealt with the constituent order in Maltese. It described the orders that are
possible, including cases in wich objects are realized both by clitics and by full NPs and provided
an HPSG analysis.  The analysis is implemented in a computer processable grammar fragment, which is
described in more detail in the proceedings of the first conference on Maltese Linguistics (<a

description of the grammar fragment covers several other phenomena in addition to constituent order.

Nakazawa, Tsuneko # 0000-0001-6991-3447 # University of Tokyo # Resultatives in Japanese as adjuncts # 2008-10-16 # no #
This paper investigates resultative phrases in Japanese and
shows that their behaviors are more consistent with adjuncts
than with obligatorily controlled complements as proposed by
some authors. It is shown that, as expected of adjuncts,
Japanese resultative phrases iterate, and do not always take a
predetermined argument of the main verb as the semantic
subject or as the antecedent of a reflexive contained in
resultative phrases. A lexical rule account is given, which
analyzes resultative phrases as adverbials and places them on
the valence list of the main verb.

Sato, Yo & Tam, Wai Lok # mailed & mailed # King's College § Queen Mary University of London & Tokyo University # Towards a unified account of adjuncts # 2008-10-15 # #
We present an analysis of adjuncts which, while based on the
traditional binary adjunction schema, accommodates the phenomena that
motivate the alternative Adjunct-as-Complement approach, such as
adjunct extraction and case marking. The key idea is to enable the
syntactic head (modifiee) to select for its modifier (adjunct) via the
new valence feature dedicated for adjuncts, while leaving its values
underspecified. Thus the selectional property of the modifiee
percolates as well as that of the modifier, dispensing with the need
to endow adjuncts a complement-like status.

We consider two alternatives for memory management in
typed-feature-structure-based parsers by identifying structural
properties of grammar signatures that may be of some predictive
value in determining the consequences of those alternatives.  We
define these properties, summarize the results of a number of
experiments on artificially constructed signatures with respect to
the relative rank of their asymptotic cost at parse-time, and
experimentally consider how they impact memory management.

The lexical information of verbal lexemes, such as verbs and adjectives, plays an important role in
syntactic parsing, because the structure of a sentence mainly hinges on the type of verbal lexemes.
The question we address in this research is how to acquire the argument structure (henceforth
ARG-ST) of verbal lexemes in Korean.  It is well known that manual build-up of type hierarchy
usually cost too much time and resources, so an alternative method, namely automatic collection of
relevant information is much more preferred.  This paper proposes a procedure to automatically
collect ARG-ST of Korean verbal lexemes from a Korean Treebank.  Specifically, the system we develop
in this paper first extracts lexical information of ARG-ST of verbal lexemes from a 0.8 million
graphic word Korean Treebank in an unsupervised way, checks the hierarchical relationship among
them, and builds up the type hierarchy automatically.  The result is written in an HPSG-style
annotation, thus making it possible to readily implement the result in an HPSG-based parser for
Korean.  Finally, the result is evaluated with reference to two Korean dictionaries and also with
respect to a manually constructed type hierarchy.


Tam, Wai Lok & Sato, Yo # mailed & mailed # Queen Mary University of London & King's College # An analysis of pseudopartitives and measure phrases that say
no to extra rules # 2008-10-15 # #
Our analysis of pseudopartitives and measure phrases draws on the idea of `of' as a copula in a
pseudopartitive. The copular analysis allows us to avoid the complications caused by treating either
the numeral-noun combination before the of-phrase or the of-object as the head of a pseudopartitive
on agreement, and hence to account for all the agreement patterns without creating any extra
rule. We also outline how we can extend our analysis to handle measure phrases that do not co-occur
with of-phrases by treating these measure phrases as anaphoric, an analysis that can adapt to the
anaphoric constructions in classifier languages. Such an analysis does not only come closer to the
intuition of native speakers but also have an appeal from the perspective of the universality of
languages.

Tseng, Jesse # mailed # CNRS & University of Toulouse # The representation of syllable structure in HPSG # 2008-10-16 # #
This paper proposes a representation for syllable structure in HPSG, building on previous work by
Bird and Klein (1994), Höhle (1999), and Crysmann (2002). Instead of mapping segments into a a
separate part of the sign where syllables are represented structurally, information about
syllabification is encoded directly in the list of segments, the core of the PHONOLOGY value. Higher
level prosodic phenomena can operate on a more abstract representation of the sequence of syllables
derived from the syllabified segments list. The approach is illustrated with analyses of some
word-boundary phenomena conditioned by syllable structure in French.

Wechsler, Stephen # 0000-0003-4753-0212 # University of Texas at Austin # Dualist syntax # 2008-10-21 # #
A dualist syntax has two components: (1) the lexicon, a structured set
of formatives ('words'); and (2) rules for combining those formatives into
utterances. This paper defends syntactic dualism against three
'monist' challenges.
First, evidence for lexical argument structure can be found in deverbal
nominalization, which preserves that structure systematically. Second,
words represent the smallest units for idiom formation and contextual polysemy
effects, which is expected on the dualist view but not if word meanings
are composed in the syntax. Third, the count/mass properties of nouns suggest
an interleaving of conceptual and grammatical information in semantic
composition.

Yoo, Eun-Jung # 0000-0002-5116-0907 # Seoul National University # Transparent free relatives in English # 2008-10-14 # #
Transparent free relatives (TFRs) are constituents involving a
WH-gap dependency in which the phrase that is predicated
of the gap associated with 'what', not the wh-phrase
itself, functions as the syntactic and semantic "nucleus."
Previous analyses have either treated TFRs as a construction
radically different from ordinary FRs, utilizing such mechanisms
as parenthetical placement or grafts, or assimilated them to
ordinary FRs, relying on abstract/empty head elements and a vague
semantic relation holding between the gap and the predicate
phrase. In this paper, we investigate how the puzzling properties
of English TFRs can be accounted for in HPSG. The paper shows that
the transparency effect of TRFs can be handled by feature
inheritance from the nucleus predicate phrase, together with a
constructional constraint that deals with the exocentric property
of TFRs.
