<p>
This paper deals with Korean postpositions. They are treated as suffixes in recent lexicalist
works. But they differ syntactically from suffixes and we will propose to treat them as clitics,
i.e. words combining with a phrase in the syntax and attaching to its last lexical item in the
phonology. We treat them as weak syntactic heads, taking into account their head properties and the
syntactic similarity between the mother phrase and the host phrase. They take the latter as
complement and share most of its syntactic properties. Revising the traditional classification, we
divide postpositions into three subtypes: marking, oblique and semantic postpositions, based on
their distributional properties, such as optionality, non-nominal marking and stacking, etc. Finally
we show how our analysis can be described in the HPSG model.
