Abeillé, Anne & Godard, Danièle & Sabio, Frédéric # 0000-0002-9187-2298 & & # University of Paris 7 & CNRS, France & University of Paris 7 & CNRS, France & University of Provence, Aix, France # Two types of NP preposing in French # 2008-10-16 # #
We contrast two types of sentences with a preposed NP in French in a construction
based HPSG grammar. They differ with respect to different grammatical aspects
(syntax, semantics, pragmatics and phonology), which cluster uniquely into
constructions. Both are colloquial, a reason why they have been recognized only
recently (see Zribi-Hertz 1986, 1996, Sabio 1995, 2006). Accordingly, we rely for
the data on spoken corpora (Corpaix, CFRP) as well as on our intuitions. Both
constructions involve a partitioned semantics but this mode of composition is
associated with different effects. One construction is characterized semantically: the
preposed NP is the theme of a categorical proposition. The other construction is
characterized pragmatically: it is associated with an independent declarative clause, a
typical use of which is to signal a break in the interaction.

Arnold, Doug & Borsley, Robert D # & 0000-0002-4856-4732 # University of Essex # Non-restrictive relative clauses, ellipsis and anaphora # 2008-10-16 # #
Non-restrictive relative clauses (NRRCs) can modify constituents which undergo
`pragmatic enrichment' when they appear in answers to questions.  For example,
in an interchange like: `A: What did Jo think? B: That you should say nothing,
which is surprising.'  What B says is surprising is that `Jo thinks ...' On the
face of it, this might seem problematic for approaches to NRRCs which assume
`syntactic integration' and to support an `orphan' analysis, where NRRCs are
combined with purely conceptual representations.  In this paper we examine a
range of elliptical and anaphoric phenomena, and show that this conclusion is
misplaced. In fact, the phenomena argue strongly in favour of a syntactically
integrated analysis.

The information-structural status of clitic left dislocated arguments in
Spanish has been argued to depend crucially on their thematic role.
Earlier HPSG analyses of related phenomena in other languages do not
take into account this sort of information. A formalization will be
presented which can handle differences in information-structure arising
from different thematic roles of clitic left dislocated phrases.

Bonami, Olivier & Godard, Danièle # 0000-0003-0688-3855 & # Université Paris-Sorbonne & LLF & CNRS & U. Paris 7 # On the syntax of direct quotation in French # 2008-10-06 # #
Direct quotation raises three major problems for grammatical modelling: (i) the variety of quoted
material (which can be a non linguistic behavior, or a sign in a different language), (ii) the
embedding of an utterance inside another one, (iii) a special denotation, the content of the
quotation being the utterance itself. We propose a unary rule, which turns the quoted material into
a linguistic sign whose content is itself a behavior, which entertains a resemblance relation to the
behavior demonstrated by the speaker. Syntactically, direct quotation comes in two varieties: it can
be the complement of a quotative verb, or constitutes a head sentence, modified by an adjunct
containing a quotative verb whose complement is extracted and identified with its local features.

This paper presents a constraint-based account of verb form alternations (Short and Long Forms)
in Mauritian which, basically, is syntactically driven: Short Forms appear with Canonical
complements while Long Forms are expected with no realized complements. However, in
specific contexts, Long Forms are unexpectedly authorized in declaratives with canonical
complements and expresses Verum Focus.

Imai, Mutsumi # 0000-0001-7920-8004 # Keio University # Children's use of argument structure, meta-knowledge of the lexicon, and extra-linguistic contextual cues in inferring meanings of novel verbs # 2008-10-16 # #
Verbs are the centerpiece of the sentence, and understanding of verb meanings is essential for
language acquisition. Yet verb learning is said to be more challenging than noun learning for young
children for several reasons. First, while nouns tend
to denote concrete objects, which are perceptually
stable over time, verbs tend to refer to action events,
which are temporally ephemeral, and the beginning
and the end of the action referred to by the verb are
not clearly specified. Second, a verb takes nouns as
arguments, and the meaning of a verb is determined
as the relation between the arguments. To infer the
meaning of a verb, children need to attend to the
relation between the objects in the event rather than
the objects themselves. In so doing, children make
use of a variety of cues such as argument structure,
meta-knowledge of the lexicon, and extra-linguistic
contextual cues. In this paper, I present two lines of
my recent research concerning young children's
novel verb learning. Specifically, I first report a
cross-linguistic study (Imai et al., 2008) examining
how Japanese-, English-, and Chinese-speaking
children utilize structural and non-structural,
extra-linguistic cues when inferring novel verb
meanings. Second, I present another study examining
how young children utilize sound-meaning correlates
(sound symbolism) in their inference of novel verb
meanings. In the end, I evaluate the relative
importance of structural cues among different cues
children use in verb learning.

Whether the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC) (Ross, 1967) is a
syntactic constraint has been discussed much in the literature.  This
paper reconsiders this issue by drawing on evidence from Japanese and
Korean.  Our examination of the CSC patterns in relative clauses in
the two languages reveals that a pragmatically-based approach along
the lines of Kehler (2002) predicts the relevant empirical patterns
straightforwardly whereas alternative syntactic approaches run into
many problems.  We take these results to provide strong support for
the view that the CSC is a pragmatic principle rather than a syntactic
constraint.

Marandin, Jean-Marie # # CNRS, Université Paris 7 # The exclamative clause type in French # 2008-10-16 # #
My objective in this paper is to integrate scalar exclamatives into an HPSG grammar of
French. First, a procedure to sort out scalar exclamatives from declaratives and interrogatives is
proposed. Then, the main semantic and dialogical properties of exclamatives are presented:
veridicity, ego-evidentiality, illocutionary double life and scalarity. Finally, assuming Ginzburg &amp;
Sag 2000, the exclamative clause type is defined.
