Verbs are the centerpiece of the sentence, and understanding of verb meanings is essential for
language acquisition. Yet verb learning is said to be more challenging than noun learning for young
children for several reasons. First, while nouns tend
to denote concrete objects, which are perceptually
stable over time, verbs tend to refer to action events,
which are temporally ephemeral, and the beginning
and the end of the action referred to by the verb are
not clearly specified. Second, a verb takes nouns as
arguments, and the meaning of a verb is determined
as the relation between the arguments. To infer the
meaning of a verb, children need to attend to the
relation between the objects in the event rather than
the objects themselves. In so doing, children make
use of a variety of cues such as argument structure,
meta-knowledge of the lexicon, and extra-linguistic
contextual cues. In this paper, I present two lines of
my recent research concerning young children's
novel verb learning. Specifically, I first report a
cross-linguistic study (Imai et al., 2008) examining
how Japanese-, English-, and Chinese-speaking
children utilize structural and non-structural,
extra-linguistic cues when inferring novel verb
meanings. Second, I present another study examining
how young children utilize sound-meaning correlates
(sound symbolism) in their inference of novel verb
meanings. In the end, I evaluate the relative
importance of structural cues among different cues
children use in verb learning.
