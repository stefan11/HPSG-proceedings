Broadwell, George Aaron # 0000-0001-9184-3027 # University at Albany, State University of New York # Language description and the lexicon: Verbs of wearing in two Oaxacan languages # 2014-10-25 # # Verbs of wearing show unusual linking properties in two languages of Oaxaca: San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec and Copala Triqui. Several distinct lexical types must be recognized, and their linking to grammatical relation is not predictable on general principles.

Faghiri, Pegah & Samvelian, Pollet & Hemforth, Barbara # 0000-0001-9121-6330 & 0000-0002-6622-4117 & 0000-0001-8371-1323 # Université Sorbonne Nouvelle & Université Sorbonne Nouvelle & CNRS/Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF) #  Accessibility and word order: The case of ditransitive constructions in Persian # 2014-10-17 # # In a most recent corpus study on Persian, Faghiri & Samvelian (2014) found a significant effect of relative length in the ordering preferences between the direct and indirect objects in the preverbal domain corresponding to "long-before-short". They furthermore showed that the position of the direct object mainly depends on its degree of determination, and put into question the broadly accepted dual view based solely on differential object marking. In this paper, we provide experimental evidence in support of these corpus findings and further propose a unified account of ordering preferences between the two objects on the basis of conceptual accessibility.

Kalinowski, Cristin & Good, Jeff # & 0000-0001-8679-4654 # University at Buffalo & University at Buffalo # Focus as a grammatical relation: Evidence from Africa # 2014-10-25 # no # Current research into the typology of the encoding
of grammatical relations recognizes the importance of both
relational roles and referential properties of arguments (Bickel 2011).
Relational roles, in this context, refer to those
deriving from the semantic relationship between the verb and its
arguments, of the sort often discussed under the
rubric of thematic roles. Referential properties, on the other hand,
refer to concepts such as animacy, specificity, and
definiteness, which are also known to influence the encoding of
grammatical relations. While relational roles have
seen the bulk of the attention devoted to modeling notions such as
subject and object, further research is needed with
respect to the range of referential properties relevant to understanding
the nature of grammatical relations.
<p>
Bickel’s recent survey suggests that information structure should be
considered as a potentially important referential
property, for instance in Mayan languages (Bickel 2011:431), where the
choice of focus constructions depends on
whether the focused element is the subject of a transitive verb versus
the single argument of an intransitive verb or a
transitive object (i.e., the constructions show ergative alignment). In
languages of Africa, the significance of information
structure for understanding the morphosyntactic properties of clauses
has long been clear (Hyman & Watters
1984), yet this is an area that remains understudied from the
perspective of grammatical relations. Focus-sensitive
grammatical relations in these languages, in particular, often
superficially resemble strategies associated with the encoding
of thematic relations in other languages with respect to their formal
properties—involving, for instance, rigid
patterns of word order, special types of case marking, or verbal
argument agreement. This can cause their differences
from grammatical relations more closely connected to thematic roles to
be underappreciated.
<p>
A recently conducted typological survey of over 130 African languages
suggests that focus is, in fact, one of the
primary properties that needs to be considered in coming to an
understanding of grammatical relations in languages of
the continent and indicates that it should be set alongside better
studied properties such as thematic roles and animacy
when considering grammatical relations typology more generally. This
paper reports on the results of the survey of
most relevance to this issue.
<p>
While the specifics of these focus encoding strategies differ, their
formal properties resemble constructions otherwise
associated with relational roles of the sort connected to thematic
relations. This is despite the fact that a property
like focus is more in line with referential properties than relational
ones. The description of such constructions is
not new here. However, they are typically discussed purely in terms of
topic and focus encoding (see, for example,
van der Wal 2009), rather than being seen as parallel to grammatical
relations in other languages. The present survey,
however, suggests that we may be dealing with an under-recognized class
of grammatical relations driven by
information-structure considerations, rather than better understood
notions such as thematic roles or animacy.

We then present a formal HPSG analysis, in which members of all open word classes enter the syntax as predicates and in which all argument NPs are derived in a uniform manner as projections of pronominal elements, modified by relative clauses, building on Sag's (1997) analysis of English relative clauses. We will then argue that, additionally, DPs may project directly to clauses, yielding a second predication structure.

When two forms coexist, *mari* ('very') and *boukou* ('a lot'), they select the predicate they modify on semantic more than syntactic criteria. We analyse degree words as adverbs with a double syntactic function: as complements in postverbal position (since they can by themselves trigger the short verbal form) and as adjuncts otherwise. We extend our analysis to inequality comparatives, *pli / plis* ('more') and *mwin / mwins* ('less') which are also polymorphic, with a double life as adjunct and complement.

Lin, Dong-yi # mailed # Ghent University # Obligatory control and event structure in Kavalan # 2014-10-07 # # The embedded verb of so-called object-control verbs in Kavalan must be affixed with the causative marker pa-. It is argued that such control predicates in Kavalan like pawRat ‘force’ feature an internal Logophoric Center in its complement clause and this property of logophoricity is absent in other control predicates. Moreover, control predicates that do not take a causativized verb complement like paska ‘try’ and tud ‘teach’ are restructuring predicates and are thus devoid of a Fin head in their complement that can be linked to an internal Logophoric Center. In contrast, the TP and CP of the complement of pawRat ‘force’-type predicates are still projected and active. The causativization of the embedded verb in a control sentence cannot be explained by a purely syntactic or semantic account of obligatory control. Instead, a comprehensive and satisfactory explanation for Kavalan obligatory control must take into account how event structure and Logophoric Center are encoded in Syntax.

obey strong island constraints in questioning: any sub-constituent of a
relative or adverbial clause can be questioned. We argue that this has to
do with how focusing works in these languages. The focused sub-constituent
remains in situ, but there is abundant morphosyntactic evidence that the
focus feature is passed up to the head of the clause. The result is the
formation of a complex focus structure in which both the head and non head
daughter are overtly marked as focus, and they are interpreted as a
pairwise list such that the focus background is applicable to this list,
but not to other alternative lists.
