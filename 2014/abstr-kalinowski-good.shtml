</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Current research into the typology of the encoding
of grammatical relations recognizes the importance of both
relational roles and referential properties of arguments (Bickel 2011).
Relational roles, in this context, refer to those
deriving from the semantic relationship between the verb and its
arguments, of the sort often discussed under the
rubric of thematic roles. Referential properties, on the other hand,
refer to concepts such as animacy, specificity, and
definiteness, which are also known to influence the encoding of
grammatical relations. While relational roles have
seen the bulk of the attention devoted to modeling notions such as
subject and object, further research is needed with
respect to the range of referential properties relevant to understanding
the nature of grammatical relations.
<p>
Bickel’s recent survey suggests that information structure should be
considered as a potentially important referential
property, for instance in Mayan languages (Bickel 2011:431), where the
choice of focus constructions depends on
whether the focused element is the subject of a transitive verb versus
the single argument of an intransitive verb or a
transitive object (i.e., the constructions show ergative alignment). In
languages of Africa, the significance of information
structure for understanding the morphosyntactic properties of clauses
has long been clear (Hyman & Watters
1984), yet this is an area that remains understudied from the
perspective of grammatical relations. Focus-sensitive
grammatical relations in these languages, in particular, often
superficially resemble strategies associated with the encoding
of thematic relations in other languages with respect to their formal
properties—involving, for instance, rigid
patterns of word order, special types of case marking, or verbal
argument agreement. This can cause their differences
from grammatical relations more closely connected to thematic roles to
be underappreciated.
<p>
A recently conducted typological survey of over 130 African languages
suggests that focus is, in fact, one of the
primary properties that needs to be considered in coming to an
understanding of grammatical relations in languages of
the continent and indicates that it should be set alongside better
studied properties such as thematic roles and animacy
when considering grammatical relations typology more generally. This
paper reports on the results of the survey of
most relevance to this issue.
<p>
While the specifics of these focus encoding strategies differ, their
formal properties resemble constructions otherwise
associated with relational roles of the sort connected to thematic
relations. This is despite the fact that a property
like focus is more in line with referential properties than relational
ones. The description of such constructions is
not new here. However, they are typically discussed purely in terms of
topic and focus encoding (see, for example,
van der Wal 2009), rather than being seen as parallel to grammatical
relations in other languages. The present survey,
however, suggests that we may be dealing with an under-recognized class
of grammatical relations driven by
information-structure considerations, rather than better understood
notions such as thematic roles or animacy.
