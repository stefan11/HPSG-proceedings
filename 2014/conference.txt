Culicover and Jackendoff (1999) suggest that there is considerable variation, but Den Dikken (2005) suggests with data from a variety of languages that the variation is quite limited. Modern Standard Arabic has a comparative correlative construction which is quite different from Engish and the other languages that Den Dikken considers, suggesting that there is more variation in this domain than he assumes. However, it is not difficult to provide an analysis of the construction and other related constructions within the HPSG framework.

However, a recent influential study (Phillips, 2006) claims to provide experimental evidence against extra-grammatical accounts of parasitic gaps, and in favor of syntactic accounts. Our work refutes Phillips (2006), and provides evidence that the phenomena are not purely syntactic.

I argue for a new type of non-standard constituent in German; a modifier-collocational-cluster. This type of cluster combines (i) a modifier and (ii) a
PP from a light-verb construction (or a Funktionsverbgefüge (FVG) as they are known in German) or a bare noun. Such strings are found in German in initial
(prefield) position in certain cases of apparent multiple fronting. We are dealing with a syntax-semantics mismatch here since the modifier does not semantically modify the element with which it can first syntactically combine. I show that the modifier is a collocate of both its co-prefield element but also of the verb. I propose a schema which lexically licenses the building of such clusters and I show how we can encode information about what I refer to as collocational selection
in the lexical entries of the type of lexemes involved in these multi-word strings. The analysis can be seen as lexical but does not require lexical storage
of phrasal elements.

The present study is concerned with the complex ways in which alternating relative complementisers in Coptic are employed as a morphological flagging device for unbounded dependencies in various types of relative clause constructions and wh questions. We shall argue in particular that the alternation in shape is locally conditioned by properties of the complement (TAME) and the antecedent noun (definiteness), which can be modelled via selectional features such as COMPS and MOD, plus the prosodic status of right-adjacent material (phrase vs. clitic). We shall show that all applicable conditions carry over from relatives to wh in-situ, suggesting to model the polyfunctionality of these complementisers in terms a systematic alternation between resumptive SLASH and in-situ QUE dependencies, modelled in terms of a lexical rule.
<p>
Furthermore, we shall discuss the status of unbounded dependencies and argue that the pervasiveness of resumption with relatives and ex-situ wh arguments can be attributed to the absence of gap-synsem on ARG-ST . We shall argue that apparent subject “gaps” in relative constructions are of a highly local nature, best to be understood in terms of  subcategorisation for a finite VP complement. Finally, we shall show that the ban on argument gaps does not carry over to wh ex-situ adjuncts, providing additional motivation for maintaining a systematic distinction between these two types of extraction.

A hierarchy of subconstruction types is assumed, which for each piece of evidence provided by the words and rules of the sentence, narrows down the possible frames of the verb to just one.

<p>
We propose a hierarchy of grammatical complexity for natural languages.  Unlike the familiar Chomsky hierarchy (Chomsky 1956), which deals only with uninterpreted formal languages, this hierarchy describes languages that map between overt expression and meaning.  We take as given the complexity of meaning, a product of the human conceptual system (Jackendoff 2002); the hierarchy concerns the complexity of the machinery available to express meaning.  The major layers in the hierarchy are:
<ol>
<li>	One-word grammar
<li>	Two-word grammar
<li>	Linear grammar:  Words can be strung together, but without phrase structure or grammatical categories
<li>	Simple phrase grammar:  There are phrases that consist of strings of words
<li>	Recursive phrase grammar:  Phrases can contain phrases (hence recursion is possible)
<li>	Grammar with further add-ons such as long-distance dependencies
</ol>	
Two additional branch points in the hierarchy are whether words and phrases belong to grammatical categories, and whether words can be decomposed morphologically.  
<p>
For each of these types of grammar, we propose interface rules that correlate linguistic structure with meaning, in particular allowing for “pragmatic” elaborations of meaning beyond that provided by the individual words.  As the linguistic structure becomes more complex, it offers more affordances for complex principles of interpretation.  In many cases, interface rules can do the sort of work normally attributed to syntax.  For instance, a rule such as “Agent First,” which correlates a thematic role in semantics with a linear position in linguistic expression, can implement constraints on word order even with a grammar that lacks grammatical categories and that simply concatenates words.  
<p>
The interest of the hierarchy is in its usefulness in differentiating various linguistic and quasi-linguistic phenomena for which we have previously had only the binary distinction “grammar” versus “no grammar.”  For any particular phenomenon, we can ask where it falls on the hierarchy.  For example:
<ul>
<li>	We can envision language acquisition in part as gradually climbing up the hierarchy, and we can ask which layers of the hierarchy actually can be attested in child production.  
<li>	Late second language acquisition in some individuals can be arrested at a lower point in the hierarchy, cf. the “Basic Variety” of Klein and Perdue (1997).
<li>	The Home Signs invented by deaf children with no exposure to a signed language typically achieve a certain point on the hierarchy (Goldin-Meadow 2003).
<li>	Abu-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, an emerging sign language, shows increasing grammatical sophistication in later learners, characterizable in terms of moving up the hierarchy. (Sandler et al. 2005).  Another emerging sign language, the recently discovered Central Taurus Sign Language, displays many properties of linear grammar.
<li>	Many peripheral constructions of English (e.g. compounding, how about XP?) utilize only the power of lower steps in the hierarchy (Jackendoff 2002).
<li>	Speakers under stress show impaired comprehension of certain grammatical constructions (Townsend and Bever 2001; Ferreira and Patson 2007).  Their “perceptual strategies” are principles from a lower layer of the hierarchy.
<li>	Some “full” languages such as Riau Indonesion (Gil 2009) and Pirahã (Everett 2005) appear only to use principles from lower domains of the hierarchy.
</ul>
We conclude that the human language faculty is a palimpsest that includes many of these layers.  The upper layers are more difficult to acquire and process, accounting for their late emergence in acquisition and language creation, and for their early exit in cases of language impairment.  We speculate on the possibility that some of these layers represent intermediate stages in the evolution of the human language faculty (Jackendoff 2002).

The question that occupies us in this paper is whether all languages include a significant formal syntax component or whether there are languages in which most syntactic rules are exclusively compositional. Our claims are (1) that Oneida (Northern Iroquoian) has almost no formal syntax component and is very close to a language that includes only a compositional syntax component and (2) that the little formal syntax Oneida has does not require making reference to syntactic features.

Lee, Juwon # mailed # The University of Texas at Austin # Two types of serial verb constructions in Korean: Subject-sharing and index-sharing # 2014-10-15 # # In this paper I present an account for the lexical passive Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Korean. Regarding the issue of how the arguments of an SVC are realized, I propose two hypotheses: i) Korean SVCs are broadly classified into two types, subject-sharing SVCs where the subject is structure-shared by the verbs and index-sharing SVCs where only indices of semantic arguments are structure-shared by the verbs, and ii) a semantic argument sharing is a general requirement of SVCs in Korean. I also argue that an argument composition analysis can accommodate such the new data as the lexical passive SVCs in a simple manner compared to other alternative derivational analyses.

Nakazawa, Tsuneko # # University of Tokyo # The distribution of resultatives in Japanese # 2014-10-19 # no # This paper proposes an analysis of the interpretation of the Japanese resultative construction.  Resultative phrases can be predicated not only of the object of transitive verbs and the subject of unaccusative intransitive verbs, as usually assumed, but also of the subject of transitive verbs, dative NPs, and even entities not expressed in sentences.  It is shown that, although the resultative construction is not totally productive as is the case with the English counterpart, the entities that undergo a change of state in the event described by a verb can constitute the semantic subject of resultative phrases regardless of grammatical functions or formal semantic roles given to the linguistic expressions referring to those entities.  A constructional analysis is proposed which identifies those entities in the lexical semantics of main verbs.

The complement usually appears in the left part of the Mittelfeld or in the Vorfeld. In HPSG this is canonically modeled in terms of extraction, making use of nonlocal devices such as SLASH and BIND. This paper argues that the extraction analysis is indeed appropriate for cases in which the complement is realised in the Vorfeld, but proposes an alternative for the cases in which the complement is realised in the Mittelfeld. The new treatment is based on argument inheritance, as complement raising in the Mittelfeld involves a middle distance dependency rather than a long distance dependency.

The LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system, an HPSG-based grammar engineering toolkit and also a typological meta-resource, includes several options for case assignment, and one of them, `focus case', assumes that case of the participants in basic clauses is handled via lexical rules rather than lexical entries. This phenomenon was previously only attributed to a group of Austronesian languages, and thus the focus case differed from all other case options in the Matrix which were attested for across language families. Our analysis of Kolyma Yukaghir, a nearly extinct language of North-Eastern Russia, shows that focus case can be successfully used outside of Austronesian family and therefore that the option is more universal than it was previously thought.
