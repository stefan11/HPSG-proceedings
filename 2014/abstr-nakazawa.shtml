<p>
This paper proposes an analysis of the interpretation of the Japanese resultative construction.  Resultative phrases can be predicated not only of the object of transitive verbs and the subject of unaccusative intransitive verbs, as usually assumed, but also of the subject of transitive verbs, dative NPs, and even entities not expressed in sentences.  It is shown that, although the resultative construction is not totally productive as is the case with the English counterpart, the entities that undergo a change of state in the event described by a verb can constitute the semantic subject of resultative phrases regardless of grammatical functions or formal semantic roles given to the linguistic expressions referring to those entities.  A constructional analysis is proposed which identifies those entities in the lexical semantics of main verbs.
