</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Coherence generally refers to a kind of predicate formation
where a verb forms a complex predicate with the head of its
infinitival complement. Adjectives taking infinitival complements have
also been shown to allow coherence, but the exact conditions for
coherence with adjectives appear not to have been addressed in the
literature. Based on a corpus-study (supplemented with
grammaticality judgements by native speakers) we show that adjectives
fall into three semantically and syntactically defined classes
correlating with their ability to construct coherently. Non-factive and 
non-gradable adjectives allow coherence, factive and gradable adjectives
do not allow coherence and non-factive and gradable adjectives are
tolerated with coherence. On the basis of previous work on coherence in
German we argue that coherence  allows the infinitival complement of a
verb or an adjective to be "split-up", so that the head and a dependent of this head
are associated with different information structural functions. In
this respect coherence patterns with extraction structures where the
extracted constituent has an information structural function different
from the constituent from which it is extracted. Following
literature on the information structural basis of extraction islands,
we show how the lack of coherence with factive adjectives follows from
their complements' being information structurally backgrounded, while the infinitival
complements of non-factive adjectives tend to a higher fusion with the
matrix clause. We also show that coherence is observed with
attributive adjectives as well, arguing that coherence is not a distinct
verbal property. Finally we provide an analysis of 
coherence with adjectives within HPSG.
