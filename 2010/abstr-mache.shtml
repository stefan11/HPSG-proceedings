</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
This talk dealt with verbless directives in German consisting of a directive PP and a 'mit'-PP ('with'). The main claim was that a compositional analysis would be possible: first of all, the  PP+'mit'+NP pattern is not restricted to directive meaning, it can be found with 'wh'-morphology and embedded under a small class of predicates. The impossibility of declarative illocutionary force is due to the lack of finiteness. Second, it turned out that directive PPs are indeed predicates and therefore PP+'mit'+NP pattern are part of a more general phenomenon particular to all types of non-finite predicates.
Third, it seems that the 'mit'-PP could be analysed as a manifestation of the THEME argument with structural case in the distribution of a directive phrase.
