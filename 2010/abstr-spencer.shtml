<p>
Based on the notion of a lexicon with default inheritance, I address the problem of how to provide a
template for lexical representations that allows us to capture the relatedness between inflected
word forms and canonically derived lexemes within a broadly realizational-inferential model of
morphology. To achieve this we need to be able to represent a whole host of intermediate types of
lexical relatedness that are much less frequently discussed in the literature. These include
transpositions such as deverbal participles, in which a word's morphosyntactic class changes
(e.g. verb ⇒ adjective) but no semantic predicate is added to the semantic representation and the
derived word remains, in an important sense, a "form" of the base lexeme (e.g. the 'present
participle form of the verb'). I propose a model in which morphological properties are inherited by
default from syntactic properties and syntactic properties are inherited from semantic properties,
such as ontological category (the Default Cascade). Relatedness is defined in terms of a Generalized
Paradigm Function (perhaps in reality a relation), a generalization of the Paradigm Function of
Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump 2001). The GPF has four components which deliver respectively
specifications of a morphological form, syntactic properties, semantic representation and a lexemic
index (LI) unique to each individuated lexeme in the lexicon. In principle, therefore, the same
function delivers derived lexemes as inflected forms. In order to ensure that a newly derived lexeme
of a distinct word class can be inflected I assume two additional principles. First, I assume an
Inflectional Specifiability Principle, which states that the form component of the GPF (which
defines inflected word forms of a lexeme) is dependent on the specification of the lexeme's
morpholexical signature, a declaration of the properties that the lexeme is obliged to inflect for
(defined by default on the basis of morpholexical class). I then propose a Category Erasure
Principle, which states that 'lower' attributes are erased when the GPF introduces a non-trivial
change to a 'higher' attribute (e.g. a change to the semantic representation entails erasure of
syntactic and morphological information). The required information is then provided by the Default
Cascade, unless overridden by specific declarations in the GPF. I show how this model can account
for a variety of intermediate types of relatedness which cannot easily be treated as either
inflection or derivation, and conclude with a detailed illustration of how the system applies to a
particularly interesting type of transposition in the Samoyedic language Sel'kup, in which a noun is
transposed to a similitudinal adjective whose form is in paradigmatic opposition to case-marked noun
forms, and which is therefore a kind of inflection.
