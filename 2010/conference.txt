This paper addresses the form-meaning relation of multimodal communicative actions by means of a
grammar that combines verbal input with hand gestures. Unlike speech, gesture signals are
interpretable only through their semantic relation to the synchronous speech content. This relation
serves to resolve the incomplete meaning that is revealed by gestural form alone. We demonstrate
that by using standard linguistic methods, speech and gesture can be integrated in a constrained way
into a single derivation tree which maps to a uniform meaning representation.

Huybregts (2009) makes the claim that hybrid A'-chains in Irish favor
derivational theories of syntax over representational ones such as HPSG. In
this paper, we subject this assertion to closer scrutiny. Based on a new technical proposal, we will reach the conclusion that, in principle, both derivational
and representational accounts can accomodate hybrid dependencies. Thus, no
argument against either approach can be made on the basis of the Irish data,
disconfirming Huybregts's (2009) claim.

A little discussed feature of English are non-restrictive relative clauses in which the antecedent
is normally not an NP and the gap follows an auxiliary, as in <em>Kim will sing, which Lee won't</em>. These
relative clauses resemble clauses with auxiliary complement ellipsis or fronting. There are a
variety of analyses that might be proposed, but there are reasons for thinking that the best
analysis is one where <em>which</em> is a nominal filler associated with a gap which is generally
non-nominal: a filler-gap mismatch analysis in other words.


Bildhauer, Felix & Cook, Philippa # 0000-0002-6567-5987 & mailed # Freie Universität Berlin # German multiple fronting and expected topic-hood # 2010-10-13 # #
This papers addresses information-structural restrictions on the occurrence of what is known as
"multiple fronting" in German. Multiple fronting involves the realization of (what appears to be)
more than one constituent in the first position of main clause declaratives, a clause type that
otherwise respects the verb-second constraint of German. Relying on a large body of naturally
occurring instances of multiple fronting with the surrounding discourse context, we show that in
certain contexts, multiple fronting is fully grammatical in German, in contrast to what has
sometimes been claimed previously. Examination of this data reveals two different patterns, which we
analyze in terms of two distinct constructions, each instantiating a specific pairing of form,
meaning and contextual appropriateness.


Borsley, Robert D. # 0000-0002-4856-4732 # University of Essex # An HPSG approach to Welsh unbounded dependencies # 2010-10-13 # #
Welsh is a language in which unbounded dependency constructions involve both gaps and resumptive
pronouns (RPs). Gaps and RPs appear in disjoint sets of environments. Otherwise, however, they are
quite similar. This suggests that they involve the same mechanism, and in HPSG that they involve the
SLASH feature. It is possible to provide an analysis in which RPs are associated with the SLASH
feature but are also the ordinary pronouns which they appear to be.


Chaves, Rui P. # 0000-0003-0820-6145 # University at Buffalo # On the syntax and semantics of <em>vice versa</em> # 2010-10-16 # #
This work focuses on the syntax and semantics of the expression <em>vice
versa</em>, and shows that its syntactic distribution is much more flexible than
semantically related expressions. Although <em>vice versa</em> usually appears in
clausal coordinate environments, it can in principle occur in any other type
of construction. Second, it can occur as an embedded verb phrase or even
as a noun phrase, rather than as an adjunct. This suggests that <em>vice versa</em>
is a propositional anaphor that corresponds to a converse of a propositional
antecedent. Finally, although the predicates singled out to be interchanged
are usually nominal, they can in fact be of virtually any part of speech. I
argue that a possible account of the interpretation of <em>vice versa</em> lies at the
interface between logical form (with rich decompositional lexical semantics
along the lines of Pustejovsky (1995)), and pragmatics (drawing from independent
work by Hobbs (1990) and Kehler (2002)).


Cook, Philippa & Ørsnes, Bjarne # mailed & 0000-0003-2046-2029 # Freie Universität Berlin # Coherence with adjectives in German # 2010-10-13 # #
Coherence generally refers to a kind of predicate formation
where a verb forms a complex predicate with the head of its
infinitival complement. Adjectives taking infinitival complements have
also been shown to allow coherence, but the exact conditions for
coherence with adjectives appear not to have been addressed in the
literature. Based on a corpus-study (supplemented with
grammaticality judgements by native speakers) we show that adjectives
fall into three semantically and syntactically defined classes
correlating with their ability to construct coherently. Non-factive and 
non-gradable adjectives allow coherence, factive and gradable adjectives
do not allow coherence and non-factive and gradable adjectives are
tolerated with coherence. On the basis of previous work on coherence in
German we argue that coherence  allows the infinitival complement of a
verb or an adjective to be "split-up", so that the head and a dependent of this head
are associated with different information structural functions. In
this respect coherence patterns with extraction structures where the
extracted constituent has an information structural function different
from the constituent from which it is extracted. Following
literature on the information structural basis of extraction islands,
we show how the lack of coherence with factive adjectives follows from
their complements' being information structurally backgrounded, while the infinitival
complements of non-factive adjectives tend to a higher fusion with the
matrix clause. We also show that coherence is observed with
attributive adjectives as well, arguing that coherence is not a distinct
verbal property. Finally we provide an analysis of 
coherence with adjectives within HPSG.


Flickinger, Dan # 0000-0001-7959-999X # Stanford University # Prescription and explanation:
Using an HPSG implementation to teach writing skills # 2010-10-21 # no #
Computational linguists who develop grammar implementations often begin
with the motivation to encode their hypotheses about the particular
structures and the general principles which illuminate the analysis of a
given language.  Often these hypotheses are tested either on naturally
occurring text corpora, or on systematically constructed test suites
illustrating the range of linguistic phenomena under study, including both
well-formed and ill-formed example sentences.  Since many applications
that make use of grammar implementations emphasize robustness of analysis
over precision, it is nice for the grammarian to encounter an application
where precision is demanded.  
<P>
One such application can be found in online education courses designed to
teach basic writing skills, where students are given exercises in which
they construct sentences whose grammaticality is then judged by the system.
In order to provide accurate and detailed automatic analysis of students' 
errors in composing sentences, a linguistically informed grammar (and
parser) can be useful, and perhaps even essential as the complexity of
the sentences increases.  Of course, a grammar designed to analyze only
well-formed utterances needs to be augmented for this kind of application
to include rules or mechanisms that also accommodate certain ill-formed 
inputs, since students' errors are exactly what present opportunities for
learning.
<P>
In this talk I draw on current work incorporating the English Resource
Grammar (Flickinger 2002) into an existing online course for teaching
sentence composition to elementary school students.  Adaptation of this
HPSG grammar has involved both extensions via so-called mal-rules
(Schneider and McCoy 1998, Bender et al. 2004), as well as reductions in
the grammar's coverage via <em>masking</em> to avoid unwanted ambiguity,
given the restricted vocabulary made available to the students for each
exercise.  While the present implementation has focused only on judging
syntactic well-formedness, we are also adding support for identifying
semantic errors, by testing the equivalence of the semantic representation
that the grammar assigns to the student's sentence with that of a set of
correct answers supplied for that exercise.  To accommodate systematic
mismatches in this equivalence due to errors in the student's sentence,
we employ a paraphrase mechanism analogous to the semantic transfer
approaches to machine translation. 
<P>
Our goal in this work is to provide accurate and detailed instruction to
students in response to each sentence that they write while taking these
online courses.  We are using (and abusing) the fine-grained knowledge of
English encoded in the ERG together with its mal-rule extensions, to
identify characteristic properties of student sentences which we can
associate with error types, anchored in the type hierarchies of the
lexicon and the syntactic constructions defined in the ERG.  One of the
central tensions we confront in this teaching application is in balancing
the need for a consistent view of grammaticality with a more nuanced
approach to good writing style.  Since the ERG, like many linguistically
motivated grammar implementations, is designed to be descriptively
comprehensive, adapting it to the service of prescriptive instruction is
not a straightforward task, though an interesting one.  A second
continuing challenge is to maintain a good balance between the flexibility
of the grammar and high accuracy in disambiguating to choose the one
intended analysis for each student sentence, so we can make the right
diagnosis of errors as the basis for explanations to the students.

In this paper, we will discuss the role of different levels of frequency distributions in sentence
processing and in written production, looking at French homophones. A comparison of experimental
data and corpus statistics will demonstrate that lexical frequencies as well as local and global
coherences have to be taken into account to fully explain the empirically established patterns.

Semitic languages exhibit rich nonconcatenative morphological operations, which can generate a myriad of 
derived lexemes. Especially, the feature rich, root-driven morphology in the Arabic language demonstrates the 
construction of several verb-derived nominals (verbal nouns) such as gerunds, active participles, passive 
participles, locative participles, etc. Although HPSG is a successful syntactic theory, it lacks the 
representation of complex nonconcatenative morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel HPSG representation for 
Arabic nominals and various verb-derived nouns. We also present the lexical type hierarchy and derivational rules 
for generating these verb-derived nominals using the HPSG framework.

The complexity of comparative constructions in each language has given challenges to both
theoretical and computational analyses. This paper first identifies types of comparative
constructions in Korean and discusses their main grammatical properties. It then builds a syntactic
parser couched upon the typed feature structure grammar, HPSG and proposes a context-dependent
interpretation for the comparison. To check the feasibility of the proposed analysis, we have
implemented the grammar into the existing Korean Resource Grammar. The results show us that the
grammar we have developed here is feasible enough to parse Korean comparative sentences and yield
proper semantic representations though further development is needed for a finer model for
contextual information.

This talk dealt with verbless directives in German consisting of a directive PP and a 'mit'-PP ('with'). The main claim was that a compositional analysis would be possible: first of all, the  PP+'mit'+NP pattern is not restricted to directive meaning, it can be found with 'wh'-morphology and embedded under a small class of predicates. The impossibility of declarative illocutionary force is due to the lack of finiteness. Second, it turned out that directive PPs are indeed predicates and therefore PP+'mit'+NP pattern are part of a more general phenomenon particular to all types of non-finite predicates.
Third, it seems that the 'mit'-PP could be analysed as a manifestation of the THEME argument with structural case in the distribution of a directive phrase.

Melnik, Nurit # 0000-0002-0610-915X # Oranim AC # Modal predicates in Modern Hebrew # 2010-10-26 # no # 
Modern Hebrew has different types of modal expressions whose syntactic
category is subject to ongoing debates. This study focuses on a subset:
predicative expressions which appear with infinitival VPs. The analysis
distinguishes between Class I predicates, which are associated with deontic
modality, and Class II predicates, which are epistemic. Moreover, it is
proposed that this semantic distinction has syntactic corollaries. Class I
predicates are amenable to a 'standard' control analysis. Class II
predicates, on the other hand, resemble raising constructions. Nevertheless,
closer scrutiny reveals a non-standard relationship between the Class II
modal predicate and the lower infinitival verbs with regards to word order
and agreement patterns, as well as evidence for a flat constituent
structure, thus motivating a complex predicate analysis.

In the Cognate Object Construction (COC) a typically intransitive verb
combines with a postverbal noun phrase whose head noun is morphologically
or semantically cognate to the verb. I will argue that English has a
family of COCs which consists of four different types. The COCs
share common core properties but differ with respect to some of their
syntactic and semantic properties. I will capture the ``cognateness''
between the verb and the noun in all COCs by token identities at the level
of their lexical semantic contribution. I will use an inheritance
hierarchy on lexical rule sorts to model the family relations among the
different COC types.

This paper presents a descriptive overview and formal analysis of the use of pronominal clitics for
realizing various types of arguments in Persian, with particular emphasis on object clitics in the
verbal domain. We argue that pronominal clitics behave more like suffixes than independent syntactic
elements; in cases where they take syntactic scope over an NP or a PP, they must be phrasal
affixes. We propose an HPSG analysis to account for the morphosyntactic aspects of verbal
suffixation of object clitics, possessive clitics, preverbal object clitics, and clitic doubling
constructions. Finally, we explore extensions of the analysis to periphrastic verb forms, and we
compare our proposals for Persian to previous HPSG work on clitic phenomena in other languages.
