</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Negative Polarity Items (NPI) are expressions such as English 'ever'
and 'lift a finger' that only occur in sentences that are somehow
<q>negative</q>.  NPIs have puzzled linguists working in syntax,
semantics and pragmatics, but no final conclusion as to which module
of the grammar should be responsible for the licensing has been
reached.  Within HPSG interest in NPI has developed only relatively
recently and is mainly inspired by the entailment-based approach of
Ladusaw 1980 and Zwarts 1997.  Since HPSG's CONTENT value is a
semantic representation, the integration of such a denotational theory
cannot be done directly.  Adopting Discourse Representation Theory
(DRT, Kamp and Reyle 1993, von Genabith et al. 2004) I show that it is
possible to formulate a theory of NPI licensing that uses purely
representational notions.  In contrast to most other frameworks in
semantics, DRT attributes theoretical significance to the
representation of meaning, i.e. to a <q>logical form</q>, and not only to
the denotation itself.  This makes DRT particularly well-suited to my
purpose.
