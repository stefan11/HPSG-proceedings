Editor's Note

<p>
The 14th International Conference on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (2007) was held in Stanford
and organized by the Stanford Department of Linguistics and CSLI's LinGO Lab.
<p>
The conference featured 2 invited talks and 18 papers
selected by the program committee

<p>
A workshop about <em>Constructions and Grammatical Theory</em>
was attached to the conference. It featured three invited talks
and 4 papers, selected by the program committee.
<p>
In total there were 38 submissions to the main conference and to the
workshop. 
We want to thank the respective program committee for putting this nice program together.
<p>
<p>
<p>
Thanks go to Ivan Sag, who was in charge of local arrangements.
<p>
<p>
As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.
<p>
<p>
The proceedings include all the papers except those by Adele Goldberg and Christopher Manning.
<p>

The <a href="toc.shtml">table of contents</a> lists all the
papers presented at the conference. Some papers were not submitted to
the proceedings. For these papers, we suggest contacting the authors
directly.
