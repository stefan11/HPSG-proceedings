<P>In this paper, we present a surface-based analysis
of a specific type of French parenthetical adjunct clauses introduced
by the adverb <I>comme</I> (similar to <I>as</I> in English). The
construction we focus on belongs to the domain of reported speech, and
we call it <I>reportive-comme</I> clause (RCC). The set of data we
consider exhibits a large amount of notable properties that can only
be fully explained under the assumption of constructional
constraints. Therefore, following Sag (1997) and Abeill&eacute; et
al. (1998), we base our approach on the central notion of
"construction". We claim that RCCs are adverbial extraction
contexts. We integrate them in a cross-classified typed hierarchy as a
subtype of relative clauses, and a subtype of head-adjunct and
head-filler phrases. Semantic specifications of RCCs are expressed
with constraints on different levels. We draw a general distinction
between head-modifier adjuncts and parenthetical adjuncts in order to
account for the fact that parenthetical adjuncts do not contribute the
referential content of the head phrase they selected for. We posit two
subtypes of RCCs determined by a Direct speech (and quotative)
vs. Indirect speech distribution of properties. The two sets of
defining constraints allow to characterize the restricted classes of
verbs possible in the different RCCs, the syntactic realization (gap
or pronominal affix) of their object argument and its anaphoric
semantics. This treatment constitutes a more general proposal for
direct speech or quoted argument selection, which is known as a
puzzling problem of the syntax-semantic interface. It innovates in
presenting a formalized account of reported speech phenomena and
present a typed-based classification of the semantic relations of
reported speech predicates.</P>
