<P>
This paper presents a dynamic semantic approach to the licensing of
Polarity Sensitive Items (PSIs) and n-words of Negative Concord. We
propose that PSIs are unified by the semantic scale property, which is
responsible for their sensitivity to the context; we develop a
semantic licensing analysis based on Fauconnier's (1975) scales and
Ladusaw's (1979) notion of entailment. The first part of the paper
concludes with a formalization of semantic licensing in the sense of
Ladusaw (1979) within HPSG (see, e.g., Pollard & Sag (1994)) which
allows for a uniform treatment of the licensing of PSIs and n-words of
Negative Concord and accounts for the disambiguating nature of PSIs in
scopally ambiguous sentences.
  
<P>The second part of the paper is concerned with the limitations of
semantic licensing, which, we claim, needs to be sensitive to the
context. We present the discussions of, e.g., Heim (1984) and Israel
(1996) with respect to the importance of the context in particular
licensing constellations, and then turn to linearity constraints on
licensing. We present data from German which may not be accounted for
by linearity constraints and sketch an analysis for this data which
supports the necessity of context-sensitive semantic licensing.
