<h1>ARG-ST on Phrases: Evidence from Polish</h1>

<p>
One of the major controversies in present-day HPSG is whether the
information about a word's argument structure should also be available on
this word's phrasal projections.  Some works assume that ARG-ST is present
on words only; this is the claim of, e.g., Pollard and Sag 1994, Miller and
Sag 1997, Abeill&eacute;, Godard and Sag 1998, and Bouma, Malouf and Sag
(to appear).  The reason for this assumption is that it leads to more
restrictive grammars: with this restriction, words cannot select their
arguments on the basis of the argument structure of these arguments' heads
(e.g., there seems to be no language in which a verb selects exactly VPs
with an NP[<i>dat</i>] argument).  On the other hand, various other works
assume the presence of the complete information about a word's argument
structure on this word's phrasal projections.  This is the stance of, e.g.,
Grover 1995 (to formulate a fully nonconfigurational binding theory), Frank
1994 (to deal with verb second in German), Frank and Reyle 1995 (to account
for the interactions between scope and word order in German), Calcagno and
Pollard 1997 and Abeill&eacute; and Godard 2000 (to analyze French
causatives), Baxter 1999 (in an account of purpose infinitives in
English), and Meurers 1999 (to deal with case assignment in German verb
clusters).

<p>
In this paper, I endeavor to make two kinds of linguistic contribution.
</p>


<p>
On the theory-internal side, I argue that the issue whether ARG-ST or any
such attribute should be present at the level of possibly saturated
<i>phrase</i>s, in addition to its presence on <i>word</i>s, is not an
"all or nothing" issue.  Although I show that there are some environments
in Polish which do seem to require the presence of ARG-ST on
<i>phrase</i>s, I also link this presence to the common feature of such
environments, namely, to their semantic vacuity (understood in the sense of
Pollard and Yoo 1998).  Although no formal proof can be given that this is
the only possible analysis, I try to proceed carefully by examining a
variety of possible alternatives and showing that all of them fail in one
way or another.
</p>

<p>
Since semantically vacuous environments are extremely rare, the resulting
grammar is not less restrictive than, say, a grammar which allows a verb to
subcategorize for a lexical argument (and, hence, have access to this
argument's ARG-ST), a possibility often taken advantage of in HPSG
analyses of complex predicates in various languages.
</p>

<p>
On the empirical side, I look at two rarely considered and
ill-understood constructions in Polish, namely, at "long raising"
across a preposition, and at case agreement with predicative phrases.
Neither of these constructions has been successfully analyzed so far.
Although the analyses proposed in this paper may be perceived as less
than satisfactory on the aesthetical side, they constitute the first
formal and uniform account of these phenomena.
