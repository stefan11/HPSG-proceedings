<p>Directional Serial Verb Constructions (Directional SVCs), which are
a subset of Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Thai and involve
motion-related verbs, are studied in this paper. According to two
syntactic tests, two phrase structural schemata are involved in Thai
Directional SVCs, including a recursive VP-over-VP structure and a
complementation structure. Thai Directional SVCs also exhibit a
dissociation between constituent structure and linear order. With this
distinctive syntactic structure, Thai Directional SVCs are not
reduceable to previously described SVCs. Nevertheless, within
Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, the rich featural specifications
of heads and the mechanisms available for the percolation of specific
head properties in a default interpretation of the Head Feature
Principle allow for a straightforward model of Thai Directional
SVCs. </p>
