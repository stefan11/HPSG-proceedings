The Was-w construction in German: A case study in type-coercion</h1>

<p>The so-called <i>was-w-construction</i> in German has received a fair
amount of attention in recent syntactic theorizing.  Most of the
discussion has focused on the properties of <i>was</i>.  </p>

<p>
One line of research maintains that <i>was</i> is a scope marker that
indicates the semantic scope of the wh-phrase in the embedded
interrogative clause.  The alternative view, usually referred to as
the <i>indirect analysis</i>, was first developed with respect to Hindi
(Dayal 1994) and then generalized to German (Dayal 1996).  It holds
that the <i>was</i> of the was-w-construction is associated not with the
embedded wh-phrase, but rather with the embedded clause as a whole.
</p>

<p>
Hinrichs and Nakazawa present some novel evidence in favor of an
indirect analysis of the was-w construction.  However, the main focus
of their research is on two questions that by comparison have received
little attention, namely:
</p>

<OL>
<LI>what is the set of matrix predicates that can enter into this
construction, and

<LI>
how can one account for the curious fact that predicates that
ordinarily do not license wh-complements allow such
complements in the was-w-construction?  
</OL>

<p>
On the basis of Ginzburg and Sag's verb classification (Ginzburg and
      Sag, in preparation) Hinrichs and Nakazawa identify a natural
class of predicates that license this construction and utilize the
notion of <i>type coercion</i> to account for the apparent mismatch between
the syntactic form of the embedded interrogative and its semantic
function.
