<P>
The complement structure of <I>tough</I> constructions containing VP
complements with gap sites linked to the <I>tough</I> predicate
subject has been subject to considerable discussion in the syntactic
literature, with an apparent consensus that in <I>John is easy for us
to please</I>, <I>for us</I> is a PP constituent which controls the
subject specification of the following infinitival constituent. I
reexamine the classical arguments for this position, including
Bresnan's seminal 1971 paper which first argued for this control
structure analysis, and argue that none of these arguments are
empirically tenable. In all cases, data exist which convincingly
undermine central claims or assumptions, and hence there turns out to
be no convincing reason to prefer the control structure over the
clausal analysis, introduced in Postal's 1971 monograph on crossover
and defended in the Gazdar et al. monograph on generalized phrase
structure grammar, in which <I>for us to please</I> is a clausal
complement to <I>easy</I>. I then offer a number of arguments for the
superiority of the clausal analysis, appealing to data from
comparatives, parasitic gap constructions and extraposition. My claim
that <I>tough</I> complementation of the kind alluded to is clausal
must, if sound, be compatible with standardly assumed semantics for
these constructions, in which the subject of the complement clause
must also serve as an argument of the <I>tough</I> predicate--a
conclusion seemingly at odds with a clausal complement syntax. The
difficulty is that a constituent whose denotation is one of the terms
in the relation denoted by the <I>tough</I> predicate must be
retrieved from with a clause, where it is presumably inaccessible
under normal Montegovian compositional assumptions. I offer further
cross-linguistic evidence based on Guyanese Creole that such an
apparent conflict between syntax and semantics is unavoidable, and
then offer a syntactic solution, based on work by Detmar Meurers which
posits a <SMALL>HEAD</SMALL> feature for verbs structure-shared with
their <SMALL>SUBJ</SMALL> specification. This device, which also can
be argued for in English on the basis of the <I>Richard</I>
construction and several other phenomena, offers a way for information
about the subject to be accessible to specifications of the selecting
head in a way which compromises locality to the minimal extent
possible.
