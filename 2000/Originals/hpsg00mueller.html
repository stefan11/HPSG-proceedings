<P>
In this paper I show that object to subject raising approaches as
suggested by Pollard (1994) and M&uuml;ller (1999) are problematic
since they cannot account for adjective formation in a satisfying
way. The approach by Heinz and Matiasek (1994), which is a
formalization of Haider's (1986) ideas, cannot account for modal
infinitives and control.
<P>
I develop a lexical rule based approach and it will be shown that this
approach also extends to tricky cases of remote passive.
