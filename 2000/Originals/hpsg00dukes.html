The Morphosyntax of 2P Pronouns in Tongan</h1>

<p>A number of the languages of Polynesia, including Tongan and
Samoan, display a process whereby a pronominal argument of the main
predicate of a clause appears to be realized as a preverbal 'second
position' (2P) pronoun. All other arguments, if overt, are realized
postverbally, the languages being rigidly predicate-initial. This
paper examines the characteristics of these pronouns in Tongan arguing
that in most cases they are best treated as distinct words in their
own right (though often phonologically deficient) while in a handful
of cases they are affixal material composed morphologically with a
preceding preverbal Tense/Aspect Marker (TAM). Despite the fact that
Tongan preverbal pronouns clearly do not appear in a typical argument
position, standard approaches to 2P pronominal elements (e.g. 'clitic
climbing' and 'prosodic inversion') do not seem naturally applicable
to the Tongan data. The relation-based analysis provided here exploits
a natural consequence of various potential definitions of
'subjecthood' within HPSG, treating the preverbal pronouns as the
(unique) instantation of the valence feature SUBJ and correctly
blocking the possibility of the pronoun appearing in true second
position above the TAM when a clause-initial conjunction is present,
except in particular specified circumstances. Thus the Tongan pronouns
are not strict '2P' elements despite the fact that they most often
appear in second position in a clause.
