<P>
In French, Italian, and Romanian, forms inherited
from the Latin paradigm 'esse' are used for the copula, the passive
auxiliary and tense or perfective auxiliaries. We show that the copula
and the passive auxiliary should be identified, while the tense or
perfective auxiliaries are different lexemes. Moreover, the copula has
the same description across all the Romance languages. While they all
are argument inheritance verbs, the copula and the tense or perfective
auxiliaries differ with respect to their complement structure: (i) the
second only have one complement structure (the complement participle
is complement unsaturated), the copula has two complement structures
(the predicate is either complement saturated or unsaturated); (ii)
French and Italian tense auxiliaries are the head of a flat VP, where
the participle is sister to its subcategorized complements, the
Romanian perfective auxiliary is the head of a verbal complex; (iii)
when the complement predicate is unsaturated, the Romance copula is
the head of a flat VP.</P>

<P>Two consequences of the analysis are worth mentioning. First, the
copula (and the passive auxiliary) should not be taken into account
when stating the environments for auxiliary selection in French and
Italian. Second, argument inheritance and complement structure are
different phenomena, and argue in favor of theories which
systematically distinguish between valence features and constituent
structures.
