<p>This presentation is essentially a "guided tour of interesting sites"
of the Norwegian language: passive, presentational constructions, anaphora
and V2 patterns. The data is related to issues concerning Argument Structure
and whether the analysis of root clauses in Norwegian should include a
node "C" hosting the finite verb. The paper points to areas of Norwegian
grammar which constitutes possible challenges to central proposals made
in the HPSG literature, but, in addition, it sketches possible analyses
within the HPSG framework.
