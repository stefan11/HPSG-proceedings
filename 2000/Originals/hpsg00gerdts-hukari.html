A-Subjects and Control in Halkomelem</h1>

<P>We
discuss evidence in Halkomelem, a Coast Salish language of British
Columbia, which supports the hypothesis put forward by Manning and Sag
(1999) that a universal passive argument structure (ARG-ST) is complex
and has two a-subjects. We argue that morphological and syntactic
control phenomena in Halkomelem are best described by saying that an
a-subject is accessible, where an a-subject is the first argument on
an argument structure list.</font></P> 

<P>ARG-ST &lt;b<SUB>i</SUB> &lt;a, Pro<SUB>i</SUB>, ...&gt;&gt;</P> 

<P>The
Halkomelem passive data show that two notions of subject are essential
for capturing control phenomena. One set of constructions-motion
auxiliaries, desideratives, and reflexive causatives-involve linking
to the internal a-subject. One construction-the control
construction&#150;links to either the highest a-subject or the
internal a-subject.  Similar conclusions have been drawn for data from
Russian (Perlmutter 1984), Philippine languages (Schachter 1984), and
other languages of the world. As Manning and Sag (1998) point out, one
does not have to draw the conclusion that passive must be given a
multilevel syntactic analysis from such data. Rather, their analysis
of passive, which posits a complex argument structure, easily accounts
for Halkomelem. Control facts in Halkomelem, with examples drawn from
both morphological and syntactic constructions, can be added to the
catalog of phenomenon that support this view of the
passive.</P>
