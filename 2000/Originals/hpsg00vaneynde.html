<h1>On the Notion `Minor Preposition'</h1>

<P>Since the introduction of the X-bar principles it is commonly
assumed that prepositions are heads of PPs, in the same way as nouns
and pronouns are heads of NPs. However, while this is well motivated
for a large majority of the pronouns and the prepositions in many
languages, there are also exceptions. More specifically, Van Eynde
(1999) argues that the reduced or minor pronouns of Dutch---as opposed
to their full or tonic counterparts---cannot head an NP, and the
purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that there are also
prepositions which cannot head a PP. The first section introduces the
distinction between major and minor categories. The second shows how
it can be applied to the prepositions and presents a way of treating
minor prepositions in HPSG.  The third singles out the Dutch
<em>te</em> (to) as a plausible candidate for a minor preposition
treatment, and the fourth provides criteria for the identification of
other minor prepositions. The concluding section points out the wider
significance of these findings.
