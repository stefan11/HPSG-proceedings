<p>The so-called `double' or `multiple' nominative constructions
(henceforth DNC or MNC) have been one of the puzzling phenomena in
topic-prominent languages like Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. One
intriguing property of the MNCs is that there is no conceptual limit
to the number of nominative nominals as long as the two consecutive
nominatives are in a certain semantic relation. This paper provides a
`head-driven' and 'constraint' based analysis in the sense that the
lexical head and the tight interaction among declarative constraints
play a crucial role in the formation of puzzling DNCs/MNCs.  This
analysis captures the gramamtical/functional properties of each
nominative phrase in these constructions in a precise way, while
describing the close specifier-head relation between the two
consecutive nominatives without violating the locality principle. The
analysis eventually allows us an explicit grammar for generating
DNCs/MNCs in Korean. This is achieved through the familiar mechanism
of argument composition and constraints on the lexical heads such as
noun and verb.
