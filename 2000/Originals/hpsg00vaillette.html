<p>
One kind of relative clause in Modern Hebrew is formed with a gap,  as in
(1a).  However, in certain situations, the gap can be replaced by a
resumptive pronoun, as in (1b):
</p>

<table>

<tr>    
<td> (1a)</td> <td>  <i>ha-yeled</i> </td> <td> <i>she</i> </td>  <td>
<i>ra'iti</i></td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>  </td> <td> the-boy </td>  <td> that </td> <td> saw-1.SG  </td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td> (b)</td> <td>  <i>ha-yeled</i> </td> <td> <i>she</i> </td>  <td>
<i>ra'iti</i></td> <td> <i><b>'oto</b></i><sub><i>i</i></sub></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>  </td> <td>  the-boy </td>  <td> that </td> <td>
      saw-1.SG  </td> <td>  <b>him</b><sub><i>i</i></sub></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>  </td> <td colspan=4> `the boy that I saw'  
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p> Some previous approaches, such as (Borer 1984) and (Sells 1984),
have treated gaps and resumptives with different mechanisms.  This
paper examines several properties that Hebrew resumptive pronouns
share with gaps, motivating a more unified treatment in HPSG using
non-local feature propagation for both.  This machinery is then used
in the analysis a variety of Hebrew relative clause phenomena, including
<i>in situ</i> resumptive pronouns, fronted resumptive pronouns,
relative clauses lacking a complementizer, bare gap relatives, and
subject-verb inversion.
