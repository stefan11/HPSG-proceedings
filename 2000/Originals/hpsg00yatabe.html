<P>
In this paper, I argue (i) that Japanese has constructions that are
almost the exact mirror images of the right-node raising constructions
in English, and (ii) that the properties of those constructions, which
I refer to as left-node raising constructions, can be captured
straightforwardly if and only if the CONTENT values of domain objects,
not those of signs, are assumed to be the principal locus of meaning
assembly.  In the theory proposed, it is claimed that semantic
composition (including "quantifier retrieval") takes place not when
some signs are syntactically combined to produce a new, larger sign
but when some domain objects (which are essentially prosodic
constituents) are merged (by the total or partial compaction
operation) to produce a new domain object (i.e. a new, larger prosodic
constituent).
