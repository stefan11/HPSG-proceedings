<p>This paper examines the distribution of English self-pronouns
(<i>himself</i>, <i>herself</i>, etc.) in contrast with personal
pronouns. We confirm that there are factors affecting the
acceptability of self-pronouns at the syntactic, semantic, and
discourse levels, and devise a Principle A with three distinct clauses
to account for all of them. Each clause is crucially ordered with
respect to the others, with syntax taking precedence over semantics,
which in turn takes precedence over discourse constraints.</p>
