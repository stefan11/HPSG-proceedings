<P>Formalized as a systematic interaction between a
tier of co-arguments and a tier of co-dependents, the concept of
diathesis offers a considerable theoretical advantage in stating
linguistic generalizations. Based on Slavic data, this paper argues
for the general notion of dependents in HPSG, in addition to arguments
and subcategorized elements (valence). It attempts to provide a
systematic inventory of ARG-ST / DEPS mappings which results in a
diathetic paradigm. The approach offers an insightful cross-linguistic
and cross-constructional perspective.</P>
