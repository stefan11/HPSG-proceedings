<P>
This paper discusses the behavior of picture NP reflexives in German
and English. Taking the analysis of Pollard/Sag (1994) as a starting
point, we show that their main conclusion for English, viz. that
picture NP reflexives are exempt from Principle A, does not apply to
German. As a first step, we present an alternative formulation of
Principle A for German. But the principles proposed for German and
English do not offer any explanation for the universal behavior of
anaphors if they cannot be related to each other. We thusn propose a
more general Principle A to hold universally. Individual,
language-specific instantiations of this Principle A are derived from
determining certain parameter settings.
