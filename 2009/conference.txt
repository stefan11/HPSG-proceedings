Bîlbîie, Gabriela & Laurens, Frédéric # 0000-0002-4547-1645 & mailed # LLF, Université Paris Diderot Paris 7 # A construction-based analysis of verbless relative adjuncts in French and Romanian # 2009-10-15 # #
French and Romanian verbless relative adjuncts are incidental adjuncts which 
have been described as elliptical relative clauses. We show that this analysis 
is not empirically adequate and propose an alternative non-elliptical analysis. 
We analyze verbless relative adjuncts as sentential fragments whose head can be 
a cluster of phrases. They are marked by a functor phrase which displays 
selection properties with respect to the head phrase and makes an essential 
contribution to the semantics of the adjunct. The analysis relies on the 
interaction of grammatical constraints introduced by various linguistic objects, 
as well as on a constructional analysis of verbless relative adjuncts 
distinguishing several subtypes.

Modern Persian conjugation makes use of five periphrastic constructions. We contrast the properties
of these five constructions and argue that they call for different analyses. We propose contrasting
analyses relying on the combination of an HPSG approach to feature geometry and syntactic
combination, and an approach to paradigm organization and morphological exponence based on Paradigm
Function Morphology. This combination of analytic tools allows us to treat the whole array of
periphrastic constructions as lexical in origin&mdash;no phrasal construction or multi-word lexical
entry of any kind is required.

Previous HPSG accounts of extraction blur the distinction between
valents and adjuncts by allowing verbs to lexically control the
modifiers that combine with their phrasal projections. However,
assuming that adjuncts are valents runs into various difficulties.
This paper argues that the distinction between complements and
adjuncts can be maintained, and that certain semantic
phenomena that challenge traceless theories of extraction can be seen
as an instance of a more general process. Finally, this paper also
discusses a uniform mechanism for case assignment to valents and
adverbial nominals.

In this paper, I discuss the case and agreement system of Nias, a
language that has been described as a marked-absolutive system by
various authors (Donohue and Brown, 1999; Corbett, 2006; Cysouw, 2005;
Handschuh, 2008; Wichmann, 2005). I shall argue in particular that the
ergativity of this language is highly superficial in nature, showing
that hypothesised marked-absolutive arguments fail to display typical
subject properties. Extending the linking theory of ergativity by
Manning (1994) and Manning and Sag (1999), which assumes an inverse
linking pattern for transitive, I shall suggest that Nias
transitives are best analysed as a Nominative-Accusative system,
attributing the <q>ergative</q> split in Nias to an <q>inverse</q> linking of
intransitives instead. Under this perspective, case, agreement, and word
order will receive a natural explanation.

Although the original framework of HPSG is mostly compatible with
independent theoretical claims or analyses in lexical lexeme base morphology
(Anderson 1992, Aronoff & Fudeman 2004, Beard 1995, Booij 2005,
Carstairs-McCarthy 1992, Fradin 2003, Haspelmath 2002, Matthews 1991, Plag
2003, for example), so far, most research in morphology has been done on
inflexional phenomena (Orgun & Inkelas 2002, Bonami & Boyé 2006), and few on
derivational morphology (Koenig 1999, Riehemann 1998). Yet, we believe it is
worth investigating how the formal and theoretical apparatus of HPSG deals
with capturing multilevel constraints that apply in the lexeme formation of
French Verb-Noun nominal compounds, such as as GRILLE-PAIN (lit.
grill-bread, `toaster'), PERCE-OREILLE (lit. pierce-ear, `earwig'),
TOURNEVIS (lit. turn-screw, `screwdriver'), or LÈCHE-VITRINE (lit.
lick-window, `window-shopping'). Contrary to what has often been said, we
argue VN lexemes formation comes under morphological constraints but not
under syntactic mechanisms. Our analysis integrates VN lexemes into a
multiple-dimension typed-hierarchy of lexemes and provides an account for
semantic generalizations involved in different types of lexeme formation
(compounding, derivation, and conversion).

We address three properties of Turkish morphology and
 VP coordination: the identification of tense and aspect values
 across conjuncts, the optional omission of affixes on non-final
 conjuncts coordinated with the word <i>ve</i> and the obligatory
 sharing of scopal modals across conjuncts in coordination structures
 with the affix <i>-ip</i>.  For the modals in an <i>-ip</i>
 structure, we propose an analysis that uses syntactic features to
 trigger the application of a construction at the level of the
 coordinated VP introducing the scopal predications.  Our analysis is
 implemented in a small HPSG grammar and tested against datasets
 confirming the functionality and consistency of the analysis.

Holler, Anke # mailed # University of Göttingen # Towards an analysis of the adverbial use of German interrogative <em>was</em>
(`what') # 2009-10-15 # #
The paper discusses the so-called adverbial use of the <em>wh</em>-pronoun
<em>was</em> (`what'), which establishes a non-standard interrogative
construction type in German.  It argues that the adverbial use of <em>was</em>
(`what') is based on the lexical properties of a categorically deficient
pronoun <em>was</em> (`what'), which bears a causal meaning. In addition,
adverbial <em>was</em> (`what') differs from canonical argument <em>was</em>
(`what')  as it is analyzed as a functor which is generated in
clause-initial position.
<p>
By means of empirical facts mainly provided by d'Avis (2001) it is shown
that <em>was</em> (`what') behaves ambivalently regarding the
<em>wh</em>-property: On the one hand, <em>was</em> (`what') can introduce an
interrogative clause, but on the other hand it cannot license
<em>wh</em>-phrases in situ. While formally analyzing the data against the
background of existing accounts on <em>wh</em>-interrogatives couched in the
framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, an analysis is developed
that separates two pieces of information to keep track of the
<em>wh</em>-information percolating in an interrogative clause. Whereas the
WH-value models <em>wh</em>-fronting and pied-piping phenomena, the QUE value
links syntactic and semantic information and thus keeps track of
<em>wh</em>-phrases in-situ.

In this paper we develop an HPSG syntax-semantics of negative concord in
Romanian. We show that n-words in Romanian can best be treated as negative
quantifiers which may combine by resumption to form polyadic negative
quantifiers. Optionality of resumption explains the existence of simple
sentential negation readings alongside double negation readings. We solve
the well-known problem of defining general semantic composition rules for
translations of natural language expressions in a logical language with
polyadic quantifiers by integrating our higher-order logic in Lexical
Resource Semantics, whose constraint-based composition mechanisms directly
support a systematic syntax-semantics for negative concord with polyadic
quantification.

Kay, Paul & Sag, Ivan A. # mailed & no # University of California, Berkeley & Stanford University # How hard a problem would this be to solve? # 2009-10-14 # #
This paper analyzes the interrelation
of two understudied phenomena of English: 
discontinuous modifier phenomenon (<strong>so</strong> <em>willing to help
  out <strong>that they called early</strong>; <strong>more</strong> <em>ready for
  what was coming</em> <strong>than I was</strong>) and the complex 
pre-determination phenomenon (<em>this</em> <em>delicious a lasagna</em>;
<em>How</em> <em>hard a problem</em> (<em>was it</em>)<em>?</em>). Despite
their independence, they frequently occur
intertwined, as in <strong>too</strong> <em>heavy {a trunk</em>} <strong>(for me)
  to lift</strong> and <strong>so</strong> <em>lovely a melody</em> <strong>that some
    people cried</strong>. This paper presents a declarative analysis of
these and related facts that avoids syntactic movement in favor
of monotonic constraint satisfaction. It demonstrates how
an explicit, sign-based, constructional approach to grammatical
structure captures linguistic generalizations, while at the same time
accounting for idiosyncratic facts in this seemingly
complex grammatical domain.

Lahm, David # mailed # Universität Tübingen # An alternative to the HPSG raising principle on the description-level # 2009-10-15 # #
I reconsider the HPSG Raising Principle which is introduced in Pollard & Sag (1994) to constrain the
way in which lexical entries describe the SUBCAT lists of the words they license. On the basis of
whether a complement is assigned a semantic role in a lexical entry or not, this entry may not or
must describe this complement as structure-shared with the unrealised subject of some other
(non-subject) complement. The formal status of this principle is still unclear, as it is formulated
as a 'meta principle' that does not talk about linguistic objects directly but rather about the
lexical entries that license them. I show that, although its meaning cannot be expressed faithfully
by the usual kind of constraints employed in HPSG, the Raising Principle can nevertheless be
replaced by two such constraints which make largely the same predictions. Most importantly, these
constraints interact with the output values of description-level lexical rules in the style of
Meurers (2001) in a way that makes predictions available that Pollard & Sag (1994) intended the
Raising Principle to make but that it cannot possibly make if description-level lexical rules are
employed.

Müller, Stefan # 0000-0003-4413-5313 # Freie Universität Berlin # On predication # 2009-10-04 # #
This paper discusses copula constructions in English, German, and Danish and argues that a uniform
analysis of all copula constructions is inappropriate. I provide evidence from German that there
should be a raising variant of the copula in addition to an identificational copula. A unary schema
is provided that maps referential NPs that can be used as arguments onto predicational NPs. Data
from Danish shows that predicational NPs can be subjects in specificational structures. An account
for such specificational structures is provided and the different behaviour of predicational and
specificational structures with regard to question tags is explained. A similar contrast can be
found in German left dislocation structures, which follows from the assumptions made in this paper.
<p>
A modified treatment of complex predicate formation allows for a reduction of selectional features
(that is abolishing of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">xcomp</span> or <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">vcomp</span>) and for a uniform treatment of predicational
phrases in copula constructions and resultative secondary predicates. This yields an account for
constituent order variants that remained unexplained by earlier analyses.

The present paper gives an account of Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Mandarin Chinese. After a
typological presentation of the phenomenon, we give an overview of the Chinese data with examples of
the semantic variations of SVCs. The inventory of SVC types is classified according to causal and
temporal relations between the components. We also discuss the pragmatic conditions on the use of
SVCs as well as alternative, semantically equivalent constructions. A HPSG-analysis is proposed for
marked SVCs, which uses the interaction between aspect marking and the set of possible subordinative
relations to deduce the extra-lexical meaning of the construction. Particular attention is payed to
the syntactically peculiar SVC with shared internal arguments, which is accounted for by a
non-cancellation approach to valence requirements.

Ørsnes, Bjarne # 0000-0003-2046-2029 # Freie Universität Berlin # Preposed negation in Danish # 2009-10-13 # #
In Danish the base position of the negation and negated
quantifier phrases  is between the subject and
the finite verb in embedded clauses. However, in embedded clauses
introduced by a non-veridical complementizer such as <em>hvis</em> (`if')
or <em>om</em> (`whether') the negation and negated
quantifier phrases can also
appear between the complementizer and the subject. This phenomenon is
referred to as preposed negation. The paper investigates the structure
and semantics of this construction. It is argued that preposed
negation is no adjunction structure, but a special construction where
the negation element is a sister of the complementizer and the filler
of a filler-gap-structure. It is further argued that preposed negation is associated with negated
verum-focus of a clause lacking an (aboutness-) topic. The
negation of a verum predicate explains why preposed negation fails to license strong
negative polarity items and to rule out positive ones. The lack of a
topic explains why preposed negation is preferred with
non-referential subjects and with weak readings of
indefinite subjects and why preposed negation is incompatible with
topic-binding particles.The final section presents an HPSG-analysis of preposed
negation using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS).

Poornima, Shakthi & Koenig, Jean-Pierre # mailed & 0000-0002-5431-5978 # State University of New York at Buffalo # Hindi aspectual complex predicates # 2009-10-15 # #
This paper discusses ergative case assignment in Hindi and its interaction with aspectual verb
complexes or complex predicate constructions. It is shown that ergative case is assigned by the last
head in the aspectual verb complex and that ergative case on the subject of intransitive verbs
denoting bodily-functions is associated with a counter-to-expectation meaning. It is then shown that
aspect complex predicates in Hindi involve two distinct syntactic structures, which have similar
semantics. While one syntactic structure involves argument composition, the other involves a
head-modifier structure. It is argued that the existence of two structures favor approaches to the
interface between syntax and semantics which do not require a uniform isomorphism between the
semantics and syntax of aspect.

In this paper we investigate German idioms which contain phraseologically
fixed clauses (PCl). To provide a comprehensive HPSG theory of PCls we
extend the idiom theory of Soehn 2006 in such a way that it can
distinguish different degrees of regularity in idiomatic expressions. An
in-depth analysis of two characteristic PCls shows how our two-dimensional
theory of idiomatic expressions can be applied and illustrates the scope
of  the theory.

The paper aims to present approach to HPSG phonology which would account for underlying forms of
phonemes. It shows some of the issues arising in monostratal analyses of phonology, and proposes a
solution based on a notion of underlying representations. The approach presented, partly inspired by
Optimality Theory, resolves cases of neutralisation and opacity by formulating constraints which
either restrict the surface representation or relate it to the underlying form.

This paper explores the use of HPSG for modeling historical phonological change and
grammaticalization, focusing on the evolution of the pronunciation of word-final consonants in
Modern French. The diachronic evidence is presented in detail, and interpreted as two main
transitions, first from Old French to Middle French, then from Middle French to the modern
language. The data show how the loss of final consonants, originally a phonological development in
Middle French, gave rise to the grammaticalized external sandhi phenomenon known as consonant
liaison in modern French. The stages of development are analyzed formally as a succession of HPSG
lexical schemas in which phonological representations are determined by reference to the immediately
following phonological context.

The analysis of the copula as a semantically vacuous word in mainstream
HPSG is appropriate for some of its uses, such as the progressive and
the passive, but not for its use in clauses with a predicative complement.
In such clauses the copula denotes a relation
of coreference between the indices of the subject and the predicative
complement.
