</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
I reconsider the HPSG Raising Principle which is introduced in Pollard & Sag (1994) to constrain the
way in which lexical entries describe the SUBCAT lists of the words they license. On the basis of
whether a complement is assigned a semantic role in a lexical entry or not, this entry may not or
must describe this complement as structure-shared with the unrealised subject of some other
(non-subject) complement. The formal status of this principle is still unclear, as it is formulated
as a 'meta principle' that does not talk about linguistic objects directly but rather about the
lexical entries that license them. I show that, although its meaning cannot be expressed faithfully
by the usual kind of constraints employed in HPSG, the Raising Principle can nevertheless be
replaced by two such constraints which make largely the same predictions. Most importantly, these
constraints interact with the output values of description-level lexical rules in the style of
Meurers (2001) in a way that makes predictions available that Pollard & Sag (1994) intended the
Raising Principle to make but that it cannot possibly make if description-level lexical rules are
employed.
