We want to thank the  program committee for putting this nice program together.



Thanks go to Anke Holler, Manfred Sailer, Heike Walker, Gert Webelhuth [chair], who were in charge of local arrangements.


As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.


The proceedings include all the papers except those by Danièle Godard and Anne Abeillé and Polly Jacobson.
