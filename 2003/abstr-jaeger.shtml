</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
In Jaeger (to appear) I have described clitic doubling in Bulgarian
<em>wh</em>-interrogatives which constitutes a type of Superiority violation that cannot
be accounted for by any existing analyses. By showing that clitic doubling of
object <em>wh</em>-phrases marks topicality, I raised the hypothesis that many (or maybe
all) so called Superiority effects in Bulgarian are due to topic-fronting of
<em>wh</em>-phrases. Here, I provide further support for this hypothesis and show that
there is also evidence for topic-fronting of non-object <em>wh</em>-phrases. Differences
between colloquial and formal Bulgarian are restricted to how topical objects
have to be realized at the source of the extraction (i.e. the VP), which also
makes the account readily extendable to other multiple fronting languages. The
complex ordering constraints on the left periphery are captured in a Linear
Syntax approach (similar to but different from Kathol 2000).
