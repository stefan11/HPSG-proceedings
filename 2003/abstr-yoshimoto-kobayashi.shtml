</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Floating quantifiers (FQs) in Japanese, i.e. quantifiers occurring after their host NPs floated
from their normal prenominal position, have aroused heated discussion owing to their
puzzling behavior (see e.g. Shibatani 1977, Miyagawa 1989, Yatabe 1990, and Fukushima
1991, among others).  Hitherto they have been studied mainly in the domain of syntax, but
recently a proposal has been put forward to take into account information structure based
on a functional poit of view (Takami 1998).  Adopting this approach, we propose an analysis
of Japanese sentences with FQs in which, without an essential use of the SLASH feature, an
FQ is given an interpretation on its contribution to the information structure as the sentence
is processed incrementally from left to right.  We show that this accounts for the subject-object
asymmetry (Kuroda 1983).  Furthermore, the proposed construal of FQs as anaphora is
applicable to cases where what an FQ quantifies is not identical with the denotation of its
antecedent, but a whole-part relation holds between them.
