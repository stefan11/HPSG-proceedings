This paper is concerned with such concepts as <Q>topic</Q>, <Q>focus</Q> and <Q>cognitive
status</Q> of discourse referents, which have been included under the label
<Q>information structure</Q> (alternatively <Q>information status</Q>), as they are related
in some sense to the distribution of given and new information. It addresses
the question of which information structural properties are best accounted for
by grammatical constraints and which can be attributed to non-linguistic
constraints on the way information is processed and communicated. Two logically
independent senses of given-new information are distinguished, one referential
and the other relational. I discuss some examples of linguistic phenomena that
pertain to each of these different senses and show that both are linguistically
relevant and must be represented in the grammar. I also argue that phenomena
related to both senses have pragmatic effects that do not have to be
represented in the grammar since they result from interaction of the language
system with general pragmatic principles that constrain inferential processes
involved in language production and understanding.
