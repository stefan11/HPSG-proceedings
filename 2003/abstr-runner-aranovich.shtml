Wasow (1977) argues that linguistic theory should recognize two qualitatively
distinct types of rules: syntactic rules, which can affect more "superficial"
grammatical function properties; and lexical rules, which affect deeper lexical
semantic properties of lexical items. However, lexicalist theories of grammar
have replaced syntactic rules with lexical rules leaving Wasow's dichotomy
potentially unexplained. Our goal in this paper is to recapture Wasow's insight
within a lexicalist framework such as HPSG. Building on Sag & Wasow's (1999)
distinction between lexeme and word, we claim that there is a contrast between
lexical rules that relate lexemes to lexemes (L-to-L rules) and lexical rules
that relate words to words (W-to-W rules) and that these differences follow
from the architecture of the grammar. In particular, we argue that syntactic
function features (ARGST, VALENCE, etc.) are not defined for lexemes, while
lexical semantic features (CONTENT) are. From this it follows that L-to-L rules
can affect lexical semantic features, and not syntactic function features. In
addition, since words are defined for syntactic function features, W-to-W rules
can change them. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by examining certain
differences between two types of Noun Incorporation construction, and their
relation to other rules in the grammar. We argue that Compounding Noun
Incorporation is an L-to-L type and that Classifier Noun Incorporation is a
W-to-W type; we base our argument on the interaction of Noun Incorporation and
Applicative Formation in the Paleo-Siberian language Chukchi and the isolate
language Ainu.
