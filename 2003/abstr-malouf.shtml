<h1 class="smalL">Malouf, Robert: A Quantitative Look at Mixed Category Constructions
</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Generative approaches to grammar take an Aristotelean view of syntactic
categories.  Expressions are either a member of a category or they are
not, and every member of a category has the same status. Mixed category
constructions, which show evidence of being a member of more than one
syntactic category at the same time, can raise serious problems for this
viewpoint.  For example, the word <Q>near</Q> behaves in many respects like a
typical English adjective, yet also shows many properties typical of
prepositions.  This leads Ross (1972) and others to argue for a
categorical continuum, with typical adjectives standing at one end,
typical prepositions at the other, and words like <Q>near</Q> somewhere in
the middle. On the other hand, Newmeyer (1998) argues instead that there
are in fact (at least) two words <Q>near</Q> in English - one an adjective
and one a preposition - and there is no need for gradient category
membership. In this talk, we present the results of quantitative
experiments designed to test Newmeyer's hypothesis on the basis of a
large collection of English text.  We find that there is indeed a strong
association among adjectival properties and a strong association among
prepositional properties. That is, as Newmeyer would predict, individual
occurrences of <Q>near</Q> tend to either be adjectival or prepositional, but
not both. However, this is only a tendency.  Intermediate forms, which
show a mixture of prepositional and adjectival properties, are well
attested, and in fact are not even particularly rare.  On the basis of
this evidence, it appears that neither Ross's nor Newmeyer's analyses
are fully consistent with the facts.  Instead, it seems that there is a
need for some notion of a categorial prototype which represents a
preference for canonical forms while still allowing occurrences of mixed
forms.
