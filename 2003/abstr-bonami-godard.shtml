</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Incidental adjuncts are adjuncts which are intonationally set apart from the
rest of the sentence (e.g. 'John was here, it seems.'). Incidentality
is a phonological/syntactic property, distinct from the semantic/pragmatic
property of 'parentheticality'. We argue that at least in French, the
distribution and scopal properties are incidentals are at odds with those of
other adjuncts, and thus present a challenge for current approaches to the
grammar of adjuncts.  We propose an analysis of French incidental modifiers
which integrates seamlessly with current accounts of nonincidental modifiers
and requires only conservative extensions to phrase structure grammar, along
the lines of Reape's (1994) work on order domains.
