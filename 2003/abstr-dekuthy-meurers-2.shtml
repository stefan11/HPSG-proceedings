The paper investigates a complex word order phenomenon in German
and the interaction of syntax and information structure it
exemplifies: the occurrence of subjects as part of a fronted
non-finite constituent and particularly the so-called definiteness
effect excluding (many) definite subjects from this position. We
explore the connection between focus projection and the partial
fronting cases and show that it is the subject of those verbs
which allow their subject to be the focus exponent that can be
included as part of a fronted verbal constituent. In combination
with the observation by Webelhuth (1990) that fronted verbal
constituents need to be focused, this provides a natural
explanation of the definiteness effect in terms of the information
structure requirements in these sentences.  Interestingly, the
generally ignored exceptions to the definiteness effect are
predicted by our analysis; we show that they involve definite noun
phrases which can bear focus, which allows them to be part of a
fronted verbal constituent.  Finally, building on the integrated
grammatical architecture provided in De Kuthy (2002), we formulate
an HPSG theory which captures the interaction of constraints from
syntax, information structure and intonation.
