Dear HPSG2003 contributor,

I will be editing the HPSG proceedings. At the business meeting in East
Lansing everyone agreed that a timely publication is very important and
the deadline for the final versions will therefore be strict.

I hereby invite you to submit a final version of your contribution to
the electronic proceedings to be published by CSLI Publications.

You can find the proceedings of the previous years at:

http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/HPSG/

The page limit is 20 pages. The deadline for submission is October 15th.


If you cannot submit your paper, please do see if you could:

1. turn in an abstract anyways (template below)
2. give me any citations or links for the paper (e.g., if it is
   going to appear in a journal or if you have the handout on-line)


Details on formatting are included below.

*IMPORTANT* For each submission we require:

1. a short abstract in plain text (ascii); the template for the
   abstract is included below.  I will format the abstract for you;
   just send us the requested information.

2. the paper in PDF; in addition to pdf, you can provide the paper
   in any other formats you wish (ps, html, rtf, etc.).

   Please submit your paper without page numbering.  We will add in
   the page numbering on the PDF file as we are putting the
   proceedings together.

If you are converting your paper to pdf from LaTeX via ps, then please
make sure to include the specification "times" (this ensures type 1
fonts).  For example:

     \documentclass[11pt]{article}
     \usepackage{times}

This ensures that the pdf will come out looking good and will also
allow me to make changes.


Papers are due by:

    15 October 2003

The sooner you get in your papers, the faster we can get the
proceedings on line.

   If you have any questions, please contact me at:

Stefan.Mueller@uni-bremen.de

I am looking forward to your submissions.

Greetings

    Stefan

BASIC INFO:

  Official On-line Proceedings:
       Deadline: October 15th
       *Required formats*:
                Abstract: plain text following template below
                Paper: PDF
       Additional formats: ps, rtf, html, word (etc.)

       Send to: Stefan.Mueller@uni-bremen.de

We require a brief abstract in plain text (this can simply be a
paragraph from your introduction); the paper itself must be in PDF.
These requirements make it simpler to produce an on-line readable
paper.  You may include other types of formats, any number of them,
but we do need to have one version that is PDF, in addition to the
abstract.

As with last year, we will produce a large pdf file that includes all
of the papers.  This way, readers can download the entire proceedings
as a book.

If you absolutely cannot do PDF, please let us know as soon as
possible and we will accomodate you in some way: point you to some
reasonable converters, help you with the conversion, etc.

As usual, the proceedings will be registered under an ISSN (it's the
same one for each of the proceedings).  As such, your paper counts as
a publication and, as a result, we have some formatting requirements.

PDF: The pdf format is easy to use and manipulate.  It is also easy to
prepare.  On Unix machines, the command to use is "ps2pdf file.ps"
(make sure you have US letter format).  With Word, you need to have
PDFwriter installed, then instead of printing to a printer, you can
print to a file and choose the pdf format. If you do not have access
to this conversion program, we can convert Word files for you, but
since Word files tend to be a big bother (fonts lost, tabs lost,
tables freeze up), we would much prefer you to do the conversion.
Note for LATEX users: please use "times" (it can be loaded as a
package) since this makes the pdf file easier to read on-line and
easier to manipulate for the book-length version of the proceedings.


BASIC FORMATING:

LENGTH: Up to 20 pages long (including references and diagrams).

TITLE PAGE (not included in the 20);
Make sure this is on a separate page with all lines centered:

                    TITLE
                author

                 affiliation

         Proceedings of the HPSG03 Conference

               Michigan State University, East Lansing

          http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/

ABSTRACT: We encourage the inclusion of a short (one paragraph)
          abstract just after the title page.

ACCEPTED FORMATS:

Once you have sent us your PDF version (and plain text abstract), you
may also provide us with versions of your choice which we will include
in the proceedings as well.  The basic idea is that readers can read
the PDF on-line and then down-load (print) either the PDF version or
the (possibly more nicely) formatted version.  We will not include
postscript or Word versions unless we have also received a PDF version
and an HTML abstract.


ABSTRACT INSTRUCTIONS:

Please send us the following information; use only plain text (ascii):

1. Paper Title
2. Author Name(s)
3. Email-address(es)
4. Text of Abstract
