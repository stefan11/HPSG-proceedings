Abeillé, Anne # 0000-0002-9187-2298 # Universite Paris 7 # A lexicon- and construction-based approach to coordinations # 2003-10-01 # #
Leaving aside elliptical coordinations, it is striking that no agreement
has been reached on the structure of basic coordinate constructions. We
propose that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> coordinate constructions are structurally asymmetric: the conjunction
makes a subconstituent with one of the conjuncts.
<li> such constituents can have several functions: coordinate daughter,
adjunct daughter or main clause.
</ul>
<p>
In order to show that some conjuncts should be analysed as adjuncts, we
focus on asymmetric cases of coordination, in which the order of the
conjuncts cannot be reversed, taking examples from French, Welsh and Korean.
We present an HPSG analysis which treats the <Q>coordinating</Q> conjunctions as
<Q>weak</Q> heads, with lexical subtypes, and coordinate phrases as multi-headed
constructions, with  different subtypes.

While French degree words in French have been assigned several syntactic
categories, we show that they are rather highy polymorphic adverbs (they occur
in all syntactic domains), which select the expression they modify on a purely
semantic basis. Like French adverbs in general, they occur both to the left and
to the right of the head they modify. Following previous work (a.o. van Noord
and Bouma 1994, Abeillé and Godard 1997, Bouma et al. 2000), we assign them two
different grammatical functions, adjuncts and complements. Semantically, they
differ from quantifiers. We follow Kennedy (2000) who analyzes them as scalar
predicate modifiers. Finally, the specific syntactic constraints that
characterize a subset of them can be shown to follow from, or be related to,
their weight properties (Abeillé and Godard 2000). We conclude that their
apparently idiosyncratic properties fit into a more general theory of grammar.

Beavers, John # # Stanford University # More heads and less categories: A new look at noun phrase structure # 2003-10-01 # #
Much literature in syntax has assumed that all noun phrases are
categorically headed by the determiner or the noun, with well-formedness
categorial in nature.  In this paper I develop a theory of noun phrase
structure in which both categories project noun phrases, arguing that this
better fits the indeterminacy of the criteria often cited for determining
headedness (Zwicky, 1985, inter alia). The only categorial differences
between determiners and nouns are their semantics and selectional
restrictions, and the conditions that determine well-formedness are
semantic in nature.  Specifically, a well-formed noun phrase must have
some restrictive semantics associated with nouns coupled with some
operational semantics associated with determiners (e.g. as a generalized
quantifier), and from this I show how we can derive structural
well-formedness.  Thus the need for categorial well-formedness is
nullified, providing an analysis with greater cross-linguistic import,
being compatible with languages without determiners.

Incidental adjuncts are adjuncts which are intonationally set apart from the
rest of the sentence (e.g. 'John was here, it seems.'). Incidentality
is a phonological/syntactic property, distinct from the semantic/pragmatic
property of 'parentheticality'. We argue that at least in French, the
distribution and scopal properties are incidentals are at odds with those of
other adjuncts, and thus present a challenge for current approaches to the
grammar of adjuncts.  We propose an analysis of French incidental modifiers
which integrates seamlessly with current accounts of nonincidental modifiers
and requires only conservative extensions to phrase structure grammar, along
the lines of Reape's (1994) work on order domains.

argument structure of (verbal) lexical entries, it provides a unified
account for the interaction of word order and scope in Dutch for cases

Like many oblique case markers and adpositions, the Korean dative suffix
expresses a semantic relation between coarguments of the verb.  Specifically,
Korean dative encodes a locative relation between Location and Theme, as well
as metaphorical extentions of this relation into other semantic fields,
e.g. the Experiencer-Theme relation expressed in (1); change of possession
verbs; etc.  However, unlike oblique case markers, the Korean dative is not in
paradigmatic opposition to regular case (Nominative, Accusative, and Topic
case).  We propose that dative and certain other oblique morphemes are
specified in the feature OBL, while true case morphemes encode the CASE
feature.  Dative is not 'assigned' by the verb per se, but rather its
distribution is intrinsically determined by the interaction between the
semantic CONTENT values of the verb and the dative marker, together with the
rules of semantic composition.

Left-Peripheral Constructions: A Domain-Based Approach
Even though the word order in English is rather straightforward,
the distributional possibilities of left-peripheral elements like
topic phrases,  <em>wh</em>-phrases, and negative operators
(introducing an SAI) are quite intriguing and complex.  In
particular, there seems to exist no straightforward way of
capturing the linear order asymmetries of these elements in the
main and embedded clauses. The prevailing analyses have resorted
to movement processes with multiple functional projections. The
goal of this paper is to explore an alternative analysis to such
movement-based analyses. In particular, this paper adopts the
notion of topological fields (DOMAIN) proposed by Kathol (2000,
2001) within the framework of HPSG. The paper shows that within
this DOMAIN system, the distributional possibilities as well as
the asymmetries we find in English left peripheral constructions
can easily follow from the two traditional views: (i) a topic
precedes a focus element, and (ii) in English a  <em>wh</em>-phrase
and a complementizer competes with each other for the same
position.

De Kuthy, Kordula & Meurers, W. Detmar # 0000-0003-2318-3754 & 0000-0002-9740-7442 # Ohio State University # Dealing with optional complements in HPSG-based grammar implementations # 2003-10-01 # #
This paper discusses how the English Resource Grammar (ERG)
captures the optionality of certain complements of verbs based on
a single lexical entry coupled with an ontology of markings
distinguishing optional from obligatory as well as unrealized from
realized elements. Subject-head and head-complement structures
are modified accordingly, but due to the lack of a possibility to
express and use relational goals in grammars implemented in the
LKB system, the ERG encoding falls short of the goal of treating
optional complements in a general way. Instead, it requires two
new types of `auxiliary' phrases which are otherwise unmotivated.
We show that the problem can be overcome by using a recursive
relation selecting a member from a list. The use of a lean
implementation platform not supporting such relational goals, such
as the LKB, thus results in a loss of generality of the grammars
that can be expressed, which undermines the closeness of the
implemented grammar to current linguistic analyses as one of the
hallmarks of HPSG-based grammar implementation.  The case study
presented in this paper thus supports the position argued in Götz
and Meurers (1997) that a system for the implementation of
HPSG-based grammars should include both universal implicational
principles as well as definite clauses over feature terms.


De Kuthy, Kordula & Meurers, W. Detmar # 0000-0003-2318-3754 & 0000-0002-9740-7442 # Ohio State University # The secret life of focus exponents, and what it tells us about fronted verbal projections # 2003-10-01 # #
The paper investigates a complex word order phenomenon in German
and the interaction of syntax and information structure it
exemplifies: the occurrence of subjects as part of a fronted
non-finite constituent and particularly the so-called definiteness
effect excluding (many) definite subjects from this position. We
explore the connection between focus projection and the partial
fronting cases and show that it is the subject of those verbs
which allow their subject to be the focus exponent that can be
included as part of a fronted verbal constituent. In combination
with the observation by Webelhuth (1990) that fronted verbal
constituents need to be focused, this provides a natural
explanation of the definiteness effect in terms of the information
structure requirements in these sentences.  Interestingly, the
generally ignored exceptions to the definiteness effect are
predicted by our analysis; we show that they involve definite noun
phrases which can bear focus, which allows them to be part of a
fronted verbal constituent.  Finally, building on the integrated
grammatical architecture provided in De Kuthy (2002), we formulate
an HPSG theory which captures the interaction of constraints from
syntax, information structure and intonation.

In this paper we present an analysis of English measure noun phrases.  Measure
noun phrases exhibit both distributional idiosyncrasy, in that they appear in
positions normally filled by degree adverbs: "a ten inch long string"; and
agreement discord: "ten inches is enough", "it is ten inch/*inches long".
The analysis introduces one idiosyncratic construction, the Measure Phrase
Rule, which links together syntax and inflectional morphology.  Combined with
existing rules, in particular the Noun-noun Compound Rule, the new rule
accounts for the both the distributional and agreement idiosyncrasies.  The
rule has been implemented and tested in the <a href=http://lingo.stanford.edu/erg.html>ERG</a>, a broad-coverage grammar of
English.  Our analysis supports the position that broad-coverage grammars
will necessarily contain both highly schematic and highly idiosyncratic
rules.


Gundel, Jeanette # # University of Minnesota # Information structure and referential givenness/newness: How much belongs in the grammar? # 2003-10-01 # #
This paper is concerned with such concepts as <Q>topic</Q>, <Q>focus</Q> and <Q>cognitive
status</Q> of discourse referents, which have been included under the label
<Q>information structure</Q> (alternatively <Q>information status</Q>), as they are related
in some sense to the distribution of given and new information. It addresses
the question of which information structural properties are best accounted for
by grammatical constraints and which can be attributed to non-linguistic
constraints on the way information is processed and communicated. Two logically
independent senses of given-new information are distinguished, one referential
and the other relational. I discuss some examples of linguistic phenomena that
pertain to each of these different senses and show that both are linguistically
relevant and must be represented in the grammar. I also argue that phenomena
related to both senses have pragmatic effects that do not have to be
represented in the grammar since they result from interaction of the language
system with general pragmatic principles that constrain inferential processes
involved in language production and understanding.

Haji-Abdolhosseini, Mohammad # # University of Toronto # Constraint-based approach to information structure and prosody correspondence # 2003-10-01 # #
This paper provides a constraint-based account of
information-prosody correspondence within the HPSG framework. The
starting point of the paper is Klein's (2000) account of prosodic
constituency in HPSG. However, it departs from the standard
syntactocentric architecture of grammar, and adopts a grammar design
in which syntax, phonology, and information structure are generated
in parallel, with all three applying to a common list of domain
objects. It is shown that this theoretical architecture elegantly
captures many of the various constraints that have been shown to
hold in classical views of grammar.


Holler, Anke # # University of Heidelberg § TEMIS Deutschland # An HPSG analysis of the non-integrated <em>wh</em>-relative clauses in German # 2003-10-01 # #
In this article, the so-called <em>wh</em>-relative clause construction is
investigated. The German <em>wh</em>-relative clauses are syntactically relevant as they
show both, root clause and subordinate clause properties. They matter
semantically because they are introduced by a <em>wh</em>-anaphor that has to be
resolved by an appropriate abstract entity of the matrix clause. Additionally,
the <em>wh</em>-relative clause construction is discourse-functionally peculiar since it
evokes coherence. Besides these interesting empirical characteristics,
whrelatives raise important theoretical questions. It is argued that the
standard HPSG theory has to be extended to account for non-restrictive relative
clauses in general, and to cope with the particular properties of the
<em>wh</em>-relative construction.


Jaeger, Florian # 0000-0002-1158-7308 # Stanford University # Topics First! In- and outside of Bulgarian <em>wh</em>-interrogatives # 2003-10-01 # #
In Jaeger (to appear) I have described clitic doubling in Bulgarian
<em>wh</em>-interrogatives which constitutes a type of Superiority violation that cannot
be accounted for by any existing analyses. By showing that clitic doubling of
object <em>wh</em>-phrases marks topicality, I raised the hypothesis that many (or maybe
all) so called Superiority effects in Bulgarian are due to topic-fronting of
<em>wh</em>-phrases. Here, I provide further support for this hypothesis and show that
there is also evidence for topic-fronting of non-object <em>wh</em>-phrases. Differences
between colloquial and formal Bulgarian are restricted to how topical objects
have to be realized at the source of the extraction (i.e. the VP), which also
makes the account readily extendable to other multiple fronting languages. The
complex ordering constraints on the left periphery are captured in a Linear
Syntax approach (similar to but different from Kathol 2000).


Kathol, Andreas # # University of California Berkeley # Cooperating constructions in Lai <q>lexical insertion</q> # 2003-10-01 # #
In this paper we investigate the factors conditioning a morphological
alternation on verbal heads in Lai.  We show that this alternation
eludes a simple characterization and instead exhibits a many-to-many
form-function mapping. We will further show that the facts can be
given a straightforward analysis in terms of default conditions based
on valence and polarity, together with various constructional
overrides. Our analysis thus follows recent proposals in HPSG, in
particular Malouf (forthcoming), in using a constructional type
hierarchy with defaults (<Q>cooperating constructions</Q>) as an
alternative to an Optimality Theoretic system of ranked violable
constraints.

Most researchers now agree that subcategorization correlates
significantly with semantics. But this semantic component of linking has
proved elusive. Most, if not all, theories of linking have, in pratice,
resorted to constructs that are syntactic diacritics. We show in this
paper that the implicit syntactic diacritics that plague the basic
linking constraints posited in at least some of these theories can be
eliminated, provided that (i) the metalanguage in which linguistic
constraints are written allows for true implicational statements; (ii)
one is willing to slightly increase the number of linking constraints.
We focus in particular on the linking theory presented in Davis and
Koenig 2000, Davis 2001, and Koenig and Davis 2000, but we maintain that
our arguments apply, mutatis mutandis, to many other linking theories.
We note some of the consequences of this view of linking, including:
linking constraints are stated in terms of semantically natural classes
of situations, a single entailment of a verb's argument is sufficient to
determine its linking, and interaction among linking constraints
restricts the range of possible lexical items.



Levine, Robert D. & Sag, Ivan A. # # Ohio State University & Stanford University # Some empirical issues in the grammar of extraction # 2003-10-01 # #
This paper compares transformation-based and constraint-based treatments of
unbounded filler-gap dependencies, the latter specifically as articulated in
terms of HPSG, and argues, contrary to the commonly made allegations of
notational variance , that there is purely empirical evidence that is
consistent with only the constraint-based account. Recent proposals to deal
with parasitic gaps in terms of null pronominals and empty operators are unable
to account for the phenomenon of symbiotic gaps, the apparent case mismatches
found in parasitic gap constructions, or (in general) for the well-known
across-the-board effects within coordinate structures.


Levy, Roger & Oshima, David Yoshikazu # 0000-0002-4493-8864 & 0000-0003-2788-8866 # Stanford University # Non-transitive information flow in Japanese noun-classifier matching # 2003-10-01 # #
In Japanese, as in other classifier languages like Chinese and Malay, numerals
do not directly quantize nouns, but first combine with a classifier to form a
measure phrase (MP; cf. Aikhenvald 2000). From the perspective of
constraint-based approaches to syntax/semantics, the mutual selective
restriction between classifiers and nouns can be stated in terms of
information-sharing and featural identity, to some extent parallel to the
treatment of gender/number agreement (between determiner and noun, for
instance) (cf. Pollard and Sag 1994; Kathol 1999). There are, however, data
that challenge this line of approach to noun-classifier matching. We
demonstrate in this paper that it is possible that a single noun is associated
with different types of classifier, and show why they are problematic for
unification-based approaches, similar to the situation with case syncretism in
European languages (Ingria 1990 and others). Later in the paper, we argue that
information-sharing between noun, predicate and classifier is not completely
transitive, and present a formal analysis which models multiple selectional
requirements with sets.


Malouf, Robert # # San Diego State University # A quantitative look at mixed category constructions # 2003-10-01 # no #
Generative approaches to grammar take an Aristotelean view of syntactic
categories.  Expressions are either a member of a category or they are
not, and every member of a category has the same status. Mixed category
constructions, which show evidence of being a member of more than one
syntactic category at the same time, can raise serious problems for this
viewpoint.  For example, the word <Q>near</Q> behaves in many respects like a
typical English adjective, yet also shows many properties typical of
prepositions.  This leads Ross (1972) and others to argue for a
categorical continuum, with typical adjectives standing at one end,
typical prepositions at the other, and words like <Q>near</Q> somewhere in
the middle. On the other hand, Newmeyer (1998) argues instead that there
are in fact (at least) two words <Q>near</Q> in English - one an adjective
and one a preposition - and there is no need for gradient category
membership. In this talk, we present the results of quantitative
experiments designed to test Newmeyer's hypothesis on the basis of a
large collection of English text.  We find that there is indeed a strong
association among adjectival properties and a strong association among
prepositional properties. That is, as Newmeyer would predict, individual
occurrences of <Q>near</Q> tend to either be adjectival or prepositional, but
not both. However, this is only a tendency.  Intermediate forms, which
show a mixture of prepositional and adjectival properties, are well
attested, and in fact are not even particularly rare.  On the basis of
this evidence, it appears that neither Ross's nor Newmeyer's analyses
are fully consistent with the facts.  Instead, it seems that there is a
need for some notion of a categorial prototype which represents a
preference for canonical forms while still allowing occurrences of mixed
forms.

It is a much-debated issue whether one should assume separate lexical
entries for participles used in passive and perfect constructions
or whether there is just one lexical entry that is used in different
ways depending on whether a passive or perfect auxiliary is present in the clause.
<p>
In previous work I criticized approaches trying to analyze the passive
with one lexical entry for making empirically wrong predictions
and suggested a lexical-rule based approach were two different
lexical items for the participle are licensed.
<p>
In this paper I show how Heinz and Matiasek's (1994) formalizations of Haider's (1986) ideas
can be extended and modified in a way that both modal infinitives and control constructions
can be captured correctly. The suggested analysis needs only one lexical item
for participles, base form infinitives, and <em>zu</em> infinitives irrespective
of their usage in active or passive like structures.

This paper shows that the Gerund Phrase (GP) in the Spanish Gerund Construction
(e.g., El jefe entró a su oficina corriendo, lit.  The boss entered his office
running ) is sometimes a complement (in SGCC) and sometimes an adjunct (in
SGCA). Although in both cases, the GP expresses a non-argument of the main
lexical verb's denotation, it is a syntactic adjunct in SGCA and a syntactic
dependent of the main clause s head in SGCC. We argue that there is a semantic
correlate of this syntactic difference and propose a general principle that
constrains the semantic relations that can hold between the denotata of heads
and added members of their ARG-ST lists: The two denotata must be part of a
larger macro-event in the sense of Talmy (2000). We further show that the
relation between the events denoted by the gerund and main verbs involves four
semantic conditions and that which subset of those four conditions are
satisfied in a particular SGCC sentence determines what subkind of SGCC is
involved.

to the usual treatments of semantics in HPSG, and to the traditional
generalised quantifier view of NPs as sets of sets. Instead we outline an
analysis of NPs as (possibly functional) sets of individuals.

Wasow (1977) argues that linguistic theory should recognize two qualitatively
distinct types of rules: syntactic rules, which can affect more "superficial"
grammatical function properties; and lexical rules, which affect deeper lexical
semantic properties of lexical items. However, lexicalist theories of grammar
have replaced syntactic rules with lexical rules leaving Wasow's dichotomy
potentially unexplained. Our goal in this paper is to recapture Wasow's insight
within a lexicalist framework such as HPSG. Building on Sag & Wasow's (1999)
distinction between lexeme and word, we claim that there is a contrast between
lexical rules that relate lexemes to lexemes (L-to-L rules) and lexical rules
that relate words to words (W-to-W rules) and that these differences follow
from the architecture of the grammar. In particular, we argue that syntactic
function features (ARGST, VALENCE, etc.) are not defined for lexemes, while
lexical semantic features (CONTENT) are. From this it follows that L-to-L rules
can affect lexical semantic features, and not syntactic function features. In
addition, since words are defined for syntactic function features, W-to-W rules
can change them. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by examining certain
differences between two types of Noun Incorporation construction, and their
relation to other rules in the grammar. We argue that Compounding Noun
Incorporation is an L-to-L type and that Classifier Noun Incorporation is a
W-to-W type; we base our argument on the interaction of Noun Incorporation and
Applicative Formation in the Paleo-Siberian language Chukchi and the isolate
language Ainu.

Such utterances pose several puzzles: they convey
`sentence-type' messages (propositions, questions or request)
while being of non-sentential form; and they are constrained
both semantically and syntactically by the context. We address
these puzzles in our approach which is compositional, since we
provide a formal semantics for such fragments independent of
their context, and constraint-based because resolution is
based on collecting contextual constraints.


Sells, Peter # 0000-0003-4284-6947 # Stanford University # Negatives of imperatives # 2003-10-01 # no #
In this paper I investigate some empirical and theoretical issues
regarding the presence of negation in imperatives, focussing on
Korean.  Korean has a special form of negation which appears in
imperative clauses, and I argue that the conditions governing the
choice of regular negation or imperative negation are purely semantic
in nature.  In particular, I argue that imperative negation constrains
the denotation of its clause to be of type OUTCOME in the system of
Ginzburg and Sag (2000), as opposed to regular negation which appears
with PROPOSITIONS or QUESTIONS.  OUTCOMEs are built from irrealis soas
(i-soa) while the others are built from realis soas (r-soa).  The
partitioning of the two negations must go along these high-level
semantic lines.  As in other languages with polite or honorific
morphology, clause-type distinctions that Korean makes morphologically
are typically neutralized in the presence of honorific morphology, and
in such cases, using one negation or other disambiguates an example to
just those clause denotations built out of an i-soa or an r-soa.
I also compare a lexically-based HPSG analysis with a derivational
account treating imperative negation as the spell-out of a combination
of abstract functional heads.

Tanenhaus, Michael K. # # University of Rochester # Interactions with context in language comprehension: Implications and challenges # 2003-10-01 # no #
During the last decade, psycholinguists have begun to
investigate language comprehension using natural tasks in which the
participants have well-defined behavioral goals.  The results of these
investigations lead to a view of language processing in which
linguistic and non-linguistic information are rapidly integrated to
dynamically update referential domains, inform parsing decisions, and
develop context-specific interpretations. I'll review some of these
results, most of which are broadly consistent with the HPSG framework.
I'll also outline some challenges for grammatical frameworks that seek
to inform processing work, inviting members of the HPSG community to
take up these challenges or point the psycholinguistic community to
relevant existing work.  Some of the easier challenges involve the
discourse "meaning" of phrasal and clausal constructions; harder
challenges involve the plasticity of the processing system.

Following a common practice in generative grammar, HPSG treats the 
determiners as members of a separate functional part of speech (Det).
The status of the functional parts of speech is a matter of debate and
controversy. The auxiliaries, for instance, are commonly treated as 
members of a separate functional category (Aux or Infl) in many variants 
of generative grammar, including GB, MP and LFG, but in 
GPSG and HPSG, it is a matter of equally common practice 
to treat them as members of V and to reject the postulation of 
a separate functional category, see 
Pullum & Wilson (1977) and Gazdar, Pullum & Sag (1982).
This text makes a similar case for the determiners; more
specifically, it argues that the determiners are categorially 
heterogeneous, in the sense that some are members of A, whereas 
others are members of N. The argumentation is mainly based on   
inflectional morphology and morpho-syntactic agreement data. 
The consequences of the categorial heterogeneity are hard to 
reconcile with the specifier treatment of the determiners in
Pollard & Sag (1994) and with the Det-as-head treatment in
Netter (1994), but it can smoothly be integrated in the 
functor treatment of the prenominals in Allegranza (1998) and 
Van Eynde (2002). 

Yoo, Eun-Jung # # Seoul National University # Specificational pseudoclefts in English # 2003-10-01 # #
Specificational pseudoclefts (SPCs) have been a great challenge for a syntactic theory, 
because, despite the surface division between the pre- and post-copular elements, 
the post-copular `pivot' behaves as if it occupied the gap position in the precopular 
<em>wh</em>-clause. This paper argues that movement-based or deletion-based syntactic approaches 
and purely semantic approaches have problems in dealing with syntactic properties 
and connectivity problems of SPCs in English. Observing the parallelism between 
SPC pivots and short answers to questions, it proposes an HPSG account based on 
a non-deletion-based QDT (Question-in-disguise theory) approach and on the 
equative analysis of the specificational copular sentences. The paper shows that 
SPCs must be handled by an integrated account of the syntactic, semantic, and 
pragmatic properties of the construction, and argues that the connectivity problems 
should be approached from such an integrated view.


Yoshimoto, Kei & Kobayashi, Masahiro  # & # Tohoku University #Floating quantifiers in Japanese as non-floating anaphora # 2003-10-01 # no #
Floating quantifiers (FQs) in Japanese, i.e. quantifiers occurring after their host NPs floated
from their normal prenominal position, have aroused heated discussion owing to their
puzzling behavior (see e.g. Shibatani 1977, Miyagawa 1989, Yatabe 1990, and Fukushima
1991, among others).  Hitherto they have been studied mainly in the domain of syntax, but
recently a proposal has been put forward to take into account information structure based
on a functional poit of view (Takami 1998).  Adopting this approach, we propose an analysis
of Japanese sentences with FQs in which, without an essential use of the SLASH feature, an
FQ is given an interpretation on its contribution to the information structure as the sentence
is processed incrementally from left to right.  We show that this accounts for the subject-object
asymmetry (Kuroda 1983).  Furthermore, the proposed construal of FQs as anaphora is
applicable to cases where what an FQ quantifies is not identical with the denotation of its
antecedent, but a whole-part relation holds between them.
