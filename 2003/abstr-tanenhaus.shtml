</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
During the last decade, psycholinguists have begun to
investigate language comprehension using natural tasks in which the
participants have well-defined behavioral goals.  The results of these
investigations lead to a view of language processing in which
linguistic and non-linguistic information are rapidly integrated to
dynamically update referential domains, inform parsing decisions, and
develop context-specific interpretations. I'll review some of these
results, most of which are broadly consistent with the HPSG framework.
I'll also outline some challenges for grammatical frameworks that seek
to inform processing work, inviting members of the HPSG community to
take up these challenges or point the psycholinguistic community to
relevant existing work.  Some of the easier challenges involve the
discourse "meaning" of phrasal and clausal constructions; harder
challenges involve the plasticity of the processing system.
