</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
In this paper I investigate some empirical and theoretical issues
regarding the presence of negation in imperatives, focussing on
Korean.  Korean has a special form of negation which appears in
imperative clauses, and I argue that the conditions governing the
choice of regular negation or imperative negation are purely semantic
in nature.  In particular, I argue that imperative negation constrains
the denotation of its clause to be of type OUTCOME in the system of
Ginzburg and Sag (2000), as opposed to regular negation which appears
with PROPOSITIONS or QUESTIONS.  OUTCOMEs are built from irrealis soas
(i-soa) while the others are built from realis soas (r-soa).  The
partitioning of the two negations must go along these high-level
semantic lines.  As in other languages with polite or honorific
morphology, clause-type distinctions that Korean makes morphologically
are typically neutralized in the presence of honorific morphology, and
in such cases, using one negation or other disambiguates an example to
just those clause denotations built out of an i-soa or an r-soa.
I also compare a lexically-based HPSG analysis with a derivational
account treating imperative negation as the spell-out of a combination
of abstract functional heads.
