<p>
In Pollard & Sag (1994) and in Ginzburg & Sag (2000) 
phrases are either headed or non-headed, and if they are
headed, there is a relation of selection between the daughters: 
either the head daughter selects
its non-head sister(s), as in the phrases of type `head-complements', 
or the non-head daughter selects its head
sister, as in the phrases of type `head-adjunct'. 
In the non-headed phrases, by contrast, there is no
selection; in a coordinate structure, for instance, there is no relation of
selection, neither between the conjuncts nor between the conjunction and 
the conjuncts. The central claim of this paper is that there
are also phrases which are headed but in which neither daughter
selects the other. 
To model such phrases I propose a new type, called
`head-independent'. Its properties are spelled out and its range
of application is illustrated with various examples, 
including asymmetric coordination and apposition.
