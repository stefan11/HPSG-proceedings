<h1 class="smalL">Müller, Stefan: Phrasal or Lexical Resultative Constructions?
</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Starting in the nineties more and more linguistic articles were published
in the framework of Construction Grammar. Although Kay and Fillmore (1999, p.&nbsp;19) made it clear
that Constructions are not necessarily phrasal, most of the authors suggest
phrasal Constructions. This is especially apparent in Construction Grammar-inspired
work in the framework of HPSG.
<P>
In this paper, I show that the difference between phrasal approaches and
lexical approaches is not as big as it is sometimes claimed,
but that the decision for one of the approaches nevertheless may have serious
consequences. The discussion focuses on resultative
constructions, a phenomenon for which both phrasal and lexical analyses
were suggested. I show that an enormous amount of different Constructions
is needed to account for all patterns that may arise because of reordering of
constituents or realization of the resultative construction in connection
with valence changing processes. It will be shown that adjuncts,
predicate complexes, and derivational morphology pose considerable
problems for the phrasal approach, while they are unproblematic for
lexical rule-based approaches.
