Ball, Douglas # # Stanford University # Tongan noun incorporation: Lexical sharing or argument inheritance # 2005-10-14 # # 
As has been shown in other Polynesian languages, in Tongan, adnominal elements
can modify incorporated nouns in the noun incorporation construction. Two
analysis are considered in this paper for understanding this construction
within HPSG. The first, lexical sharing (Kim and Sells, this volume), views the
verbs that include incorporated nouns as being single words corresponding to
two syntactic atoms. However, this analysis makes incorrect predictions on the
transitivity of incorporation clauses. A second analysis, extending Malouf
(1999), views these words as verbs, but with some of the combinatorial
properties of nouns. This offers both a better account of the data, and
preserves the more restrictive theory of the morphology-syntax interface.


Beavers, John # # CSLI, Stanford University # Towards a semantic analysis of argument/oblique alternations in HPSG # 2005-10-15 # #
    I examine the semantic contrasts exhibited by argument/oblique alternations 
(argument realization alternations where one or more participants may
be realized either as a direct argument or an oblique). Previous HPSG accounts 
of these have proposed that alternating verbs are ambiguous, where
each variant has a structured semantics that makes different participants more
or less structurally prominent in the semantic representation. I argue that
such accounts fail to capture the full richness of the contrasts exhibited by
such alternations, and propose instead a model that derives alternations from
the lexical entailments each verb associates with the alternating participant.

In this paper we present a proposal to integrate pragmatic

In this paper I address the phenomenon of syncretism in German and
show how Flickinger (2000)'s approach to related issues in English can be
adapted to provide a compact, disjunction-free representation of German
nominal paradigms by means of combined case/number/gender type hierarchies. 
In particular, I will discuss the issue of case identity constraints in
German coordinate structures, which has so far prevented successful application 
of Flickinger's proposal to German, and show how likeness constraints
targetting individual inflectional dimensions of a combined type hierarchy
can be expressed by means of typed lists that abstract out the relevant dimension.
<p>
I further show that current type-based approaches to feature neutrality
are unable to combine the treatment of this phenomenon with the virtues of
underspecification. I will then propose a revised organisation of the 
inflectional type hierarchies suggested by Daniels (2001), drawing on a systematic
distinction between inherent and external (case) requirements.

We examine how a large-scale computational grammar can account for the
complex nature of Japanese verbal compounds. Previous computational
Japanese grammars have tried to avoid the problem by simple solutions
such as enumerating as many verbal compounds in the lexicon as
possible. In contrast, we develop the analysis that is linguistically
adequate and computationally tractable and thus meets the
requirement of a syntactically and semantically precise natural
language processing of Japanese like Bond et al. (2005). Our analysis
distinguishes between two kinds of verbal compounds: syntactic
compounds, which are fully productive; and lexical compounds, which
are of varying productivity.


Holler, Anke # # University of Heidelberg # On non-canonical clause linkage # 2005-10-10 # #
The present paper investigates a certain subset of clause linkage
phenomena and develops a constraint-based account to the empirical
fact that clauses need to be distinguished with respect to their degree of
integratedness into a potential matrix clause. Considering as example
German, it is shown that the generally assumed twofold distinction
between main and subordinate clauses (or root and embedded clauses)
does not suffice to deal with the presented data. It is argued that
the discussed linkage phenomena originate from syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic properties of the clauses involved, and should hence be
encoded in grammar.

Gradient grammaticality has received renewed attention in recent
years, which is partly due to the introduction of the magnitude
estimation paradigm that allows the elicitation of reliable gradient
judgments. In the present contribution, we apply this methodology to
the study of crosslinguistic variation. We present a series of
experiments that investigate the interaction of resumption and island
violations in English, German, and Greek. The results demonstrate that
resumptive pronouns (contrary to claims in the literature) cannot
remedy island violations. Also, we find that embedding reduces
acceptability, even in constructions thought to be fully acceptable in
the literature. On the other hand, resumption can counteract the
effect of embedding in certain cases. On a more general level, we find
that crosslinguistic variation in resumption is confined to
quantitative differences in the magnitude of otherwise identical
principles. This poses an important challenge for a parametric
approach to variation, which does not predict existence of such
quantitative difference between languages. We propose that this type
of variation can be accounted for naturally in a weighted grammar
model such as Linear Optimality Theory, were a distinction between
hard and soft constraints is possible.

Focusing on the examples of multiple degree modification, this paper
argues that the class of degree expressions in English is syntactically
and semantically diverse, subdivided both according to the semantic
effects of its members and according to the extent to which they permit,
and participate in, multiple layers of modification.  We argue that
these two factors are linked, and result in (at least) a three-way
distinction between `true degree morphemes', which map gradable
adjectives to properties of individuals and combine with their arguments
in a Head-Specifier structure; `intensifiers', which are syntactic and
semantic modifiers of properties constructed out of gradable adjectives;
and `scale modifiers', which are also syntactic and semantic modifiers,
but which combine with `bare' gradable adjectives (relations between
individuals and degrees) rather than properties formed out of gradable
adjectives.

According to the Projection Principle (Chomsky 1981), expletives have
no semantic content and thus cannot occur in theta-marked positions. However, 
there are many examples where expletive <em>it</em> appears as a direct object, 
in violation of the Projection Principle. The various attempts that have
been made to account for such cases (e.g. the case-based analysis of Authier
(1991), the predication analysis of Rothstein (1995), and the Specifier analysis 
of Stroik (1991, 1996)) all posit movement of the expletive from a non-theta 
marked position to direct object position. However, these analyses have
so far been unsuccessful in capturing several important contrasts, e.g. 
variable optionality of the expletive <em>it</em>. This paper argues that such contrasts (and
the complex behavior of expletive <em>it</em> more generally) follow straightforwardly
from a lexicalist, constraint-based analysis in which lexical information and
independently motivated constraints interact in subtle ways.

We argue here for a lexicalist analysis of the Korean copula
(following Kim, Sells and Wescoat (2004)), on the basis of different
properties of sequences of noun-plus-copula, which shows word-like
behavior, in contrast to noun and negative copula, which are
independent syntactic units.  The interactions of these items with
various copy constructions brings out their clear differences.  The
analysis is formalized in HPSG using Lexical Sharing, from Wescoat
(2002).

In this paper, I first make an observation that there is a certain
parallelism in the scope interpretation possibilities of adverbs and
quantifiers with respect to different types complex predicates in
Japanese, drawing on a comparison of the light verb construction and
the causative construction. I will then argue that previous approaches
to complex predicates in Japanese in the lexicalist tradition
(Matsumoto 1996; Manning et al. 1999) fail to capture this
generalization successfully. Finally, building on a novel approach to
syntax/semantics interface in HPSG by Cipollone (2001), I develop an
analysis of the semantic structure of complex predicates that accounts
for the empirical observation straightforwardly.

This paper presents an analysis of constructions involving the
l-form of the verb in Polish, including primarily the past
tense, the conditional mood, and the future tense. Previous approaches
have attempted to treat these uniformly as auxiliary verb
constructions. We argue against a unified treatment, however, in light
of synchronic and diachronic evidence that indicates that only the
future tense and the conditional still involve auxiliaries in
modern Polish.  We show that the past tense is now a simple tense,
although the l-forms appear in combination with agreement
affixes that can appear in different places in the sentence. We
provide an account of the common linearization properties of the past
tense markings and the conditional auxiliary. We present a detailed
HPSG analysis of the past tense construction that relies on the
introduction of two interacting agreement features. We then discuss
the consequences of our proposals for the analysis of the conditional
and future auxiliary constructions, and finally, we offer a treatment
of constructions involving inflected complementizers in Polish.


Lee, Sun-Hee # # Wellesley College # A trace analysis of Korean UDCs # 2005-10-18 # #
In this paper, we claim that the filler-gap linkage in Korean UDCs
needs to be handled at the level of syntax and that unbounded
dependencies represented by traces, resumptive pronouns, and
resumptive reflexives in Korean can be simply captured &ndash; without
posing any extra mechanisms &#8211; in the traditional HPSG analysis of
UDCs following Pollard and Sag (1994). It is because in HPSG traces 
are not all required to have the same feature, unlike in other
movement-based approaches including the minimalist program and GB
theory. In addition, we argue that the three kinds of Korean UDC
elements appearing in gap positions do not form separate categories
from their corresponding forms appearing in non-UDCs based on the
same semantic and pragmatic properties such as logophoricity and
contrastiveness. We also investigate some controversial issues of
island constraints and strong crossover with respect to filler-gap
linkage in Korean UDCs.


Maekawa, Takafumi # # University of Essex # An HPSG approach to the <em>who</em>/<em>whom</em> puzzle # 2005-10-17 # #
Order domains were originally proposed to deal with constituent order, but
have recently been concerned with more than just linearization.  This paper
seeks to contribute to this discussion by considering the possibility of
analysing word forms in terms of order domains.  We focus on the
distribution of the English relative and interrogative pronouns who and
whom.  It is shown that a small number of constraints can accommodate the
seemingly complex body of data.  In particular, a linearization-based
constraint can provide a straightforward account for the quite puzzling
distribution which who and whom show in one of the register types.

The process of turning a <q>hand-written</q> HPSG theory into a working computational grammar requires
complex considerations. Two leading platforms are available for implementing HPSG grammars: 
The <a href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbTop">LKB</a> and
<a href="http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/hpsg/archive/projects/trale/">TRALE</a>. 
These platforms are based on different approaches, distinct in their underlying logics and
implementation details. This paper adopts the perspective of a computational linguist whose goal is
to implement an HPSG theory. It focuses on ten different dimensions, relevant to HPSG grammar
implementation, and examines, compares, and evaluates the different means which the two approaches
provide for implementing them. The paper concludes that the approaches occupy opposite positions on
two axes: faithfulness to the <q>hand-written</q> theory and computational accessibility. The choice
between them depends largely on the grammar writer's preferences regarding those properties.


Müller, Stefan # 0000-0003-4413-5313 # University of Bremen # Phrasal or lexical resultative constructions? # 2005-10-21 # no #
Starting in the nineties more and more linguistic articles were published
in the framework of Construction Grammar. Although Kay and Fillmore (1999, p.&nbsp;19) made it clear
that Constructions are not necessarily phrasal, most of the authors suggest
phrasal Constructions. This is especially apparent in Construction Grammar-inspired
work in the framework of HPSG.
<P>
In this paper, I show that the difference between phrasal approaches and
lexical approaches is not as big as it is sometimes claimed,
but that the decision for one of the approaches nevertheless may have serious
consequences. The discussion focuses on resultative
constructions, a phenomenon for which both phrasal and lexical analyses
were suggested. I show that an enormous amount of different Constructions
is needed to account for all patterns that may arise because of reordering of
constituents or realization of the resultative construction in connection
with valence changing processes. It will be shown that adjuncts,
predicate complexes, and derivational morphology pose considerable
problems for the phrasal approach, while they are unproblematic for
lexical rule-based approaches.

Sag, Ivan A. # # Stanford University # Adverb extraction and coordination:<br> A reply to Levine # 2005-10-26 # #
HPSG accounts of filler-gap dependencies hold considerable
potential for explaining the cross-linguistic variation in
unbounded dependency constructions (UDCs), specifically filler-gap
dependencies. This potential comes from the SLASH
specifications that are posited in all nodes along the extraction
path (the path between filler and gap).  However, as Hukari and
Levine (1994, 1995, 1996) have observed, the HPSG analysis
presented by Pollard and Sag (1994) fails to embody the
generalizations required in order to explain key universal
properties of UDCs, in particular the `registration' of such
dependencies in cases of subject- and adverb-extraction. This
demonstration led Bouma et al. (2001) to propose a revised UDC
analysis that avoids these difficulties by `threading' the SLASH
specfications through all heads within an extraction
domain. However, Levine (2002) points out that this analysis
encounters a new difficulty concerning the interaction of
extraction and coordination. This paper revisits these issues,
arguing that a small modification of the BMS analysis provides a
solution to the important problem observed by Levine.

This contribution is concerned with integrating the phenomenon of selectional
restrictions in HPSG. Firstly, the question of treating selectional
restrictions purely in the semantic module is tackled, as there are some
contextual (or pragmatic) influences, which can repair the ill-formedness of
violated selectional restrictions. Secondly, we present existing approaches to
selectional restrictions within the framework and, lastly, make our own
proposal which describes the subject as part of the semantics-pragmatics
interface. In particular, we show how a semantic ontology can be integrated.

Taghvaipour, Mehran A # # University of Essex # Persian free relatives # 2005-10-15 # #
Free relatives (FRs) in Persian are Unbounded Dependency Constructions,
containing gaps or resumptive pronouns (RPs). In some positions only gaps are
allowed, and in some other positions only RPs. The structure of Persian FRs is
bipartite, containing two constituents: a phrasal part and a
sentential. Persian FRs are sensitive to the matching effect and show distinct
properties from noun phrases, ordinary relative clauses, and interrogative
complements. This paper proposes a unified HPSG account which assumes that the
phrasal part of a FR is the head and the filler at the same time. The propped
approach is presented in two versions (with and without traces) and can take
care of the dependency between the gap or the RP and the licencing constituent
with a truly single mechanism.


Trawinski, Beata # # University of Tübingen # Plural comitative constructions in Polish # 2005-10-15 # #
This paper provides a treatment of Polish Plural Comitative Constructions
in the paradigm of HPSG in the tradition of Pollard and Sag (1994).
Plural Comitative Constructions (PCCs) have previously been treated in terms of 
coordination, complementation and adjunction. The objective of this paper is to show 
that PCCs are neither instances of typical coordinate structures nor of typical complement or 
adjunct structures. It thus appears difficult to properly describe them by means of the
standard principles of syntax and semantics. The analysis proposed in this paper accounts for the
syntactic and semantic properties of PCCs in Polish by assuming an adjunction-based syntactic 
structure for PCCs, and by treating the indexical information provided by PCCs not as subject to
any inheritance or composition,  but as a result of applying a set of principles on number, gender and
person resolution that also hold for ordinary coordinate structures.


Van Eynde, Frank # 0000-0002-6172-442X # University of Leuven # A head-driven treatment of asymmetric coordination and apposition # 2005-10-15 # #
In Pollard & Sag (1994) and in Ginzburg & Sag (2000) 
phrases are either headed or non-headed, and if they are
headed, there is a relation of selection between the daughters: 
either the head daughter selects
its non-head sister(s), as in the phrases of type `head-complements', 
or the non-head daughter selects its head
sister, as in the phrases of type `head-adjunct'. 
In the non-headed phrases, by contrast, there is no
selection; in a coordinate structure, for instance, there is no relation of
selection, neither between the conjuncts nor between the conjunction and 
the conjuncts. The central claim of this paper is that there
are also phrases which are headed but in which neither daughter
selects the other. 
To model such phrases I propose a new type, called
`head-independent'. Its properties are spelled out and its range
of application is illustrated with various examples, 
including asymmetric coordination and apposition.
