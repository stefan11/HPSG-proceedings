<p>
In total there were 39 submissions to the main conference and 13 submissions to the
workshop. 
We want to thank the respective program committees for putting this nice program together.
<p>
Thanks go to António Branco, who was in charge of local arrangements.
<p>
As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.
<p>
The proceedings include all the papers except those by 
Frank Keller and Theodora Alexopoulou, Stefan Müller and Eric Reuland. Nurit Melnik submitted
an extended abstract, the full paper will appear in a Research on Language and Computation.
<p>

The <a href="toc.shtml">table of contents</a> lists all the
papers presented at the conference. Some papers were not submitted to
the proceedings. For these papers, we suggest contacting the authors
directly.
