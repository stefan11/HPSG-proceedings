Amiridze, Nino # 0000-0001-7907-6865 # Utrecht University # Georgian reflexives in subject function in special contexts # 2005-10-15 # #
Georgian is a language allowing reflexives to be marked by ergative.
The subject use of the Georgian reflexive phrase was first
documented with causative verbs by Asatiani (1982). The later works
such as (Amiridze and Everaert, 2000), (Amiridze, 2003), (Amiridze,
2004) discuss the use with object-experiencer verbs and transitive
verbs on non-agentive reading. The present paper offers the first
hand data on subject uses of the Georgian reflexive phrase with
transitive verbs on their agentive reading in special contexts (such
as a twin context, Madame Tussaud context, etc.) which are
problematic for the Binding Theory of Chomsky (1981) as well as for
the Reflexivity Theory of Reinhart and Reuland (1993}. The data
could be accounted for within the approach developed in (Reuland,
2001). However, the subject uses of the Georgian reciprocal
<q>ertmanet-</q> leave the issue of subject anaphors open.


Branco, António # 0000-0002-7174-4942 # University of Lisbon # Reflexives: Escaping exemption via domain reshuffling # 2005-10-14 # #
In this paper we argue that at least for some languages, when
there are suitable o-commanders of its selectional domain, a
reflexive in the bottom of its obliqueness hierarchy escapes
exemption via a reshuffling of its local binding domain. The
outcome of such reshuffling is that the local domain extends to
include o-commanders of the reflexive in the subcategorization
domain immediately upstairs, that is in the domain whose head
predicator directly subcategorizes the domain headed by the
predicator directly subcategorizing the reflexive.

This paper proposes a distinct approach to local binding effects for reflexives
and pronominals in English whereby the nature of local binding domains is a
by-product of the incremental interpretation of syntactic derivations
(Uriageraka 1999, Chomsky 2000, 2001), emphasizing the role of the
Conceptual /Intentional interface and the computational system (i.e. bare
output conditions) in shaping general principles of grammars. A significant
development of the Minimalist framework is the proposal that derivations
operate through phases or multiple spell outs, which allows to reduce the
strict cyclicity of derivations, and related locality effects of movement, to
interface (bare output) conditions and economy conditions. In this paper I
propose that incremental interpretation can further capture local binding
domains effects of conditions A and B of Chomsky's (1981, 1986) Binding
Theory. Basically, local binding domains are shown to correspond to
<q>accessible phase domains</q>. Our proposal hence contrasts with standard
analyses (e.g. Reinhart and Reuland 1993, Pollard and Sag 1992) that define
co-argumenthood as the core factor from which binding conditions are
developed. Our proposal also provides a new perspective on the core
contrasts between A-chain and A-bar chain w.r.t. binding and scope
reconstruction effects and argues that checking of the uninterpretable feature
Case is what defines potential phase domains.


Everaert, Martin # 0000-0002-4418-4126 # Utrecht University # On binding domains # 2005-10-17 # #
In this paper I want to explore reasons for replacing Binding Theory based on
the anaphor-pronoun dichotomy by a Binding Theory allowing more domains
restricting/defining anaphoric dependencies. This will, thus, have consequences
for the partitioning of anaphoric elements, presupposing more types of
'anaphors'/'pronouns' than standard Binding Theory offers us.

The paper reviews basic patterns of reflexive binding in Norwegian, and
explores a possible implementation of them in an HPSG grammar using the
LKB platform. Norwegian has two reflexive elements, with distinct
constraints and corresponding 'anti-binding' effects; they can cooccur
but also occur independently. As over-all strategy for resolving
reflexive binding we use one resembling the 'slash' procedure for
wh-dependencies. Binding constraints are imposed partly through lexical
specification, partly through phrasal combination rules. Challenges are
noted residing in the possibility for sentences to contain an unbounded
number of reflexives.

Noguchi, Tohru # unknown # Ochanomizu University, Japan # Semantic composition in reflexivization # 2005-10-14 # #
It has been commonly assumed since Chomsky (1981) that the distribution of reflexive 
pronouns is subject to Binding Condition A.  Reinhart and Reuland (1993) formulate 
Condition A in terms of the notion of <q>syntactic predicate.</q>  The proposal I will 
develop in this paper is to factor out semantic and syntactic conditions on the occurrence
 of reflexive pronouns and to reduce them to independently motivated semantic and 
syntactic mechanisms.  The semantic part is attributed to a theory of semantic composition
 recently developed by Chung and Ladusaw (2004), while the syntactic residue falls into 
the proper characterization of syntactic chains, as proposed by Reinhart and Reuland (1993)
 and Reuland (2001).  To the extent that this approach is successful, Binding Condition 
A is rendered superfluous.


Pollard, Carl # mailed # Ohio State University # Remarks on binding theory # 2005-10-15 # #
We propose some reformulations of binding principle A that build on recent 
work by Pollard and Xue, and by Runner et al. We then turn to the
thorny issue of the status of indices, in connection with the seemingly
simpler Principle B. We conclude that the notion of index is fundamentally 
incoherent, and suggest some possible approaches to eliminating
them as theoretical primitives. One possibility is to let logical variables
take up the explanatory burden borne by indices, but this turns out to
be fraught with difficulties. Another approach, which involves returning
to the idea that referentially dependent expressions denote identity functions 
(as proposed, independently, by Pollard and Sag and by Jacobson)
seerms to hold more promise.


Reuland, Eric # 0000-0003-4485-4246 # Utrecht University # Binding conditions:<br> How are they derived? # 2005-10-24 # #
In this article I discuss binding conditions A and B. I show that important
properties of binding need not be stipulated, but can be explained as
consequences of general properties of the computational system underlying
human language.

This paper investigates the binding of pronouns and reflexives in <q>picture</q>
noun phrases, and focuses on data showing that reflexives and pronouns are not
in complementary distribution in picture NPs with possessors. In particular, we
discuss data showing that whereas reflexives can take either the possessor or
the subject of the sentence as antecedent, pronouns are restricted to an
antecedent other than the possessor phrase. We suggest that this asymmetry can
be straightforwardly explained if we assume that (1) the possessor of a picture
NP is not part of the head noun's argument structure and (2) Binding Theory is
stated over <q>dependents</q> structure, the representation encompassing both a
head's argument structure and other phrases dependent on it in various ways. If
the possessor of a picture NP (PNP) is not part of the head's argument
structure, it follows that reflexives in PNPs with possessors will be <q>exempt</q>
from Binding Theory, which paves the way for an analysis of the reflexive
data. Furthermore, we also show that if BT is regarded as defined over
dependents structure, it follows that a pronoun in a picture NP with a
possessor must be disjoint from that possessor phrase.

 
Stuckardt, Roland # mailed # Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main # Verifying binding constraints for anaphor resolution # 2005-10-07 # #
Algorithmic approaches to anaphor resolution are known to benefit
substantially from syntactic disjoint reference filters.
Typically, however, there is a considerable gap between the scope of the
formal model of grammar employed for deriving referential evidence and its
implementation. While accounting for many subtleties of language,
such formal models at most partially address the algorithmic aspects
of referential processing. This paper investigates the issue of implementing
syntactic disjoint reference for robust anaphor resolution. An algorithmic
account of binding condition verification will be developed that, on one hand,
captures the theoretical subtleties, and, on the other hand, exhibits
computational efficiency and fulfils the robustness requirements. Taking
as input the potentially fragmentary parses of a robust state-of-the-art
parser, the practical performance of this algorithm will be evaluated with
respect to the task of anaphor resolution and shown to be nearly optimal.
