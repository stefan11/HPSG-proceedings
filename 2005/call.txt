Dear HPSG2005/workshop contributor,

I will be editing the HPSG proceedings. At the business meeting in East
Lansing everyone agreed that a timely publication is very important and
the deadline for the final versions will therefore be strict.

I hereby invite you to submit a final version of your contribution to
the electronic proceedings to be published by CSLI Publications.

You can find the proceedings of the previous years at:

http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/HPSG/

The page limit is 20 pages (a4paper, 11pt, title page not included).
The deadline for submission is October 15th.


If you cannot submit your paper, please do see if you could:

1. turn in an abstract anyways (template below)
2. give me any citations or links for the paper (e.g., if it is
   going to appear in a journal or if you have the handout on-line)


Details on formatting and style files can be found at:

http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/HPSG/5/call.shtml

Please reade the guideline document carefully and use the checklist at the end
before sending me you contribution.

Papers are due by:

    15 October 2005

The sooner you get in your papers, the faster we can get the
proceedings on line.

   If you have any questions, please contact me at:

Stefan.Mueller@cl.uni-bremen.de

I am looking forward to your submissions.

Greetings

    Stefan
