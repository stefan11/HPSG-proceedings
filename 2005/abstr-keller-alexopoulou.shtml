<p>
Gradient grammaticality has received renewed attention in recent
years, which is partly due to the introduction of the magnitude
estimation paradigm that allows the elicitation of reliable gradient
judgments. In the present contribution, we apply this methodology to
the study of crosslinguistic variation. We present a series of
experiments that investigate the interaction of resumption and island
violations in English, German, and Greek. The results demonstrate that
resumptive pronouns (contrary to claims in the literature) cannot
remedy island violations. Also, we find that embedding reduces
acceptability, even in constructions thought to be fully acceptable in
the literature. On the other hand, resumption can counteract the
effect of embedding in certain cases. On a more general level, we find
that crosslinguistic variation in resumption is confined to
quantitative differences in the magnitude of otherwise identical
principles. This poses an important challenge for a parametric
approach to variation, which does not predict existence of such
quantitative difference between languages. We propose that this type
of variation can be accounted for naturally in a weighted grammar
model such as Linear Optimality Theory, were a distinction between
hard and soft constraints is possible.
