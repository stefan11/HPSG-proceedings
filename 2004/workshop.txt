This article proposes a semantics of directional expressions in Norwegian and
German, regarded as VP modifiers. The analysis uses Minimal Recursion
Semantics, as an integrated part of Matrix-based HPSG grammars. Directional
expressions are analyzed as modifying an individual, the 'mover'. Context
dependent directionals like here receive a decomposed analysis. Telicity values
reflecting various types of directional and locative expressions are computed.

Natural language generation utilising linguistically-motivated, 
general-purpose, grammars can conveniently be thought of as involving two 
components. The first component involves constructing some logical form that 
is accepted by the grammar, while the second (called tactical generation, or 
now more usually, realisation) involves going from the logical form to a 
string.    My main interest is in realisation, and in particular, the 
implications that supporting tractable realisation has for the nature of 
logical form in computational grammars. I am not concerned here with 
denotation, but with the form of the semantic representation and with the way 
that composition operates.
There are two main considerations. Firstly, we can make the realisation 
problem more or less difficult, depending on the meaning representation we 
choose, even though the denotation is the same.  Secondly, structure in the 
logical form may be exploited to guide realisation, and this may be necessary 
for realisation to work at all. But structure that reflects the syntax of the 
language too closely is generally to be avoided, since it can make it 
impossible for the input to the realiser to be constructed without detailed 
knowledge of the grammar.
The Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS: Copestake et al, in press) approach was 
designed to be usable for generation.
<p>
Robust realisation has three requirements:
<ol>
<li> A realisation algorithm that is efficient with minimal guidance from the 
logical form syntax.
<li> A formalism that allows sufficient abstraction over syntax that 
constructing the input to the realiser is doable.
<li> An interface layer expressing those constraints imposed by the grammar that 
have to be known to construct the input.
</ol>
Carroll et al (1999) describe an approach to chart generation which partially 
met these conditions.  A paper describing the approach to generation currently 
implemented in the LKB is in preparation: this will discuss the extent to 
which we meet these requirements now.

Crysmann, Berthold # 0000-0003-0230-502X # DFKI, Saarland University # Underspecification of intersective modifier attachment: Some arguments from German # 2004-10-01 # # 
In this paper, I shall discuss the semantic attachment of intersective
modifiers in German coherent constructions. I shall show that a purely
syntactic solution to the observable attachment ambiguity is undesirable for
reasons of processing e ciency and/or massive spurious ambiguity. Instead, I
shall follow Egg and Lebeth (1995) and propose an extension to Minimal
Recursion Semantics, permitting the expression of underspecified semantic
attachment. This rather trivial move, as we shall see, will not only be
preferable for processing reasons, but it will also be more in line with the
spirit of underspecified semantics, e ectively providing a compact
representation of purely semantic distinctions, instead of unfolding these
distinctions into a rain forest of tree representations and derivations. I will
present an implementation of the underspecification approach integrated into
the German HPSG developed at DFKI and compare its e ciency to an alternative
implementation where semantic attachment is unfolded by means of retrieval
rules.

We present a constraint-based syntax-semantics interface 
for the construction of RMRS (Robust Minimal Recursion 
Semantics) representations from shallow grammars. The 
architecture is designed to allow modular interfaces to 
existing shallow grammars of various depth - ranging 
from chunk grammars to context-free stochastic grammars. 
We define modular semantics construction principles in 
a typed feature structure formalism that allow flexible 
adaptation to alternative grammars and different languages.


Haugereid, Petter # 0000-0003-3077-8983 # NTNU Trondheim # Linking in constructions # 2004-10-01 # #
In this paper I will make an attempt to show how the linking normally done in
the lexicon also can be done in constructions. The motivation behind this is
the flexibility it gives the grammar writer in underspecifying lexical
entries. Being too rigid about linking in the lexicon may lead to unsatisfying
results such as multiple lexical entries for what one intuitively feels is just
one lexical entry, or alternatively, lexical rules which are not
morphologically motivated. The aim is to show that this can be avoided by
letting constructions introduce the linking information instead.

This paper summarizes the architecture of Lexical Resource Semantics
(LRS).  It demonstrates how to encode the language of two-sorted
theory (Ty2; Gallin, 1975) in typed feature logic (TFL), and then
presents a formal constraint language that can be used to extend
conventional description logics for TFL to make direct reference to
Ty2 terms.   A reduction of this extension to Constraint Handling
Rules (CHR; Fruehwirth & Abdennadher, 1997} for the purposes of
implementation is also presented.


Søgaard, Anders # 0000-0001-5250-4276 # Katholieke Universiteit Leuven # A compound matrix # 2004-10-01 # #
This paper presents a suplement to the Grammar Matrix, namely what I call a
Compound Matrix ; in reality, it is not a matrix, since the type file includes
a fully specified cross-linguistic inventory of compound types. The idea is
that the grammar writer can comment out the ungrammatical types for his or her
own language. The theory behind the typology is presented here in a bottom-up
fashion, from the basic assumptions to the actual linguistic types.
