<p>
Natural language generation utilising linguistically-motivated, 
general-purpose, grammars can conveniently be thought of as involving two 
components. The first component involves constructing some logical form that 
is accepted by the grammar, while the second (called tactical generation, or 
now more usually, realisation) involves going from the logical form to a 
string.    My main interest is in realisation, and in particular, the 
implications that supporting tractable realisation has for the nature of 
logical form in computational grammars. I am not concerned here with 
denotation, but with the form of the semantic representation and with the way 
that composition operates.
There are two main considerations. Firstly, we can make the realisation 
problem more or less difficult, depending on the meaning representation we 
choose, even though the denotation is the same.  Secondly, structure in the 
logical form may be exploited to guide realisation, and this may be necessary 
for realisation to work at all. But structure that reflects the syntax of the 
language too closely is generally to be avoided, since it can make it 
impossible for the input to the realiser to be constructed without detailed 
knowledge of the grammar.
The Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS: Copestake et al, in press) approach was 
designed to be usable for generation.
<p>
Robust realisation has three requirements:
<ol>
<li> A realisation algorithm that is efficient with minimal guidance from the 
logical form syntax.
<li> A formalism that allows sufficient abstraction over syntax that 
constructing the input to the realiser is doable.
<li> An interface layer expressing those constraints imposed by the grammar that 
have to be known to construct the input.
</ol>
Carroll et al (1999) describe an approach to chart generation which partially 
met these conditions.  A paper describing the approach to generation currently 
implemented in the LKB is in preparation: this will discuss the extent to 
which we meet these requirements now.
