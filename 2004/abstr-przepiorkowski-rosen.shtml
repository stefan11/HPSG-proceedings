</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
According to standard assumptions of most generative theories, both
Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan, raising and so-called Exceptional Case
Marking constructions, but not control constructions, should allow for
case transmission, i.e., the identity of the grammatical case between
the higher element (raised element, controller), and the lower element
(trace/copy, controlled PRO).  This prediction is not fulfilled for
many languages, including Czech and Polish, where, e.g., case
transmission is allowed from subjects, whether they are raised
elements or controllers.  Building on earlier observations by Hudson
1998 concerning similar facts in Icelandic and Ancient Greek, we
propose an explicit and precise account of case transmission in
control and raising constructions which builds on the standard
(Pollard and Sag 1994) HPSG approach to control and raising and on an
earlier independently motivated analysis of syntactic case assignment
(Przepiórkowski 1999).  It turns out that only minor additions to
these two grammar modules are required to successfully account for the
curious case transmission facts in Czech and Polish.
