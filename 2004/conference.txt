Of all French functional elements, the form <em>de</em> has without question the widest
variety of uses, and presents the greatest challenge for linguistic description
and analysis.  Historically a preposition, it still has a number of
prepositional uses in modern French, but in many contexts it calls for an
altogether different treatment.  We begin by outlining a general distinction
between <q>oblique</q> and <q>non-oblique</q> uses of <em>de</em>.  We then develop a detailed
account of constructions where <em>de</em> combines with an N'.  We provide a unitary
analysis of <em>de</em> in three constructions (quantifier extraction, "quantification
at a distance", and negative contexts) which have been not been considered to be
related in previous accounts.

This paper presents an account of English non-restrictive (`appositive') relative
clauses (NRCs) in the framework of `construction based' HPSG.
Specifically, it shows how the account of restrictive relative clause
constructions presented in Sag (1997) can be extended to provide an account of the
syntax and semantics of NRCs
and of the main differences between NRCs and restrictive relatives.
The analysis reconciles the semantic intuition that
NRCs behave like independent clauses with their subordinate syntax.  A significant
point is that, in contrast with many other approaches, it employs only existing,
independently motivated theoretical apparatus, and requires absolutely no new
structures, features, or types.


Beavers, John & Sag, Ivan A. # & # University of Texas & Standford University # Coordinate ellipsis and apparent non-constituent coordination # 2004-10-25 # #
Within the tradition of Categorial Grammar, so-called
`non-constituent' coordination (`argument cluster' coordination and
`right node raising') has been analyzed in terms of the coordination
of nonstandard constituents produced by the operations of type
raising and composition.  This highly successful research has
expanded the domain of data that modern analyses of coordination
must take into account. Recent HPSG work by Yatabe (2002) and
Crysmann (2003) provides an interesting alternative approach to
this problem in terms of the coordination of familiar, but
`elliptical' constituents. We argue that this approach is
empirically superior to the Categorial Grammar analysis, both in
terms of empirical coverage and cross-linguistic predictions. We
reassess the relevant English data in small but important ways, and
develop our own ellipsis analysis, building on Yatabe's and
Crysmann's insights.


Borsley, Robert D. # 0000-0002-4856-4732 # University of Essex # An approach to English comparative correlatives # 2004-10-11 # # 
Recent syntactic theory has highlighted the importance of peripheral
constructions such as the comparative correlative construction. This
construction involves a pair of filler-gap constructions with unusual
properties. The first is a subordinate clause and the second a main clause. The
construction has a number of related constructions. A version of HPSG, which
assumes hierarchies of phrase types, can provide satisfactory analyses both for
the comparative correlative constructions and for the related
constructions. The two clauses in the comparative-correlative construction can
be analysed as non-standard head-filler phrases differing from standard
headfiller phrases in certain respects. The construction as a whole can be
analyzed as a non-standard head-adjunct phrase, in which the head and the
phrase have different categories.

Linearization-based HPSG theories are widely used for analyzing languages with
relatively free constituent order. This paper introduces the Generalized ID/LP
(GIDLP) grammar format, which supports a direct encoding of such theories, and
discusses key aspects of a parser that makes use of the dominance, precedence,
and linearization domain information explicitly encoded in this grammar
format. We show that GIDLP grammars avoid the explosion in the number of rules
required under a traditional phrase structure analysis of free constituent
order. As a result, GIDLP grammars supportmore modular and compact grammar
encodings and require fewer edges in parsing.


de Swart, Henriette # # Universiteit Utrecht # A typology of negation in a constraint-based framework of syntax and semantics # 2004-10-01 # #
Negation and negative indefinites raise problems for the principle of compositionality 
of meaning, because we find both double and single negation readings in natural 
languages. De Swart and Sag (2002) solve the compositionality problem in a polyadic 
quantifier framework. The syntax-semantics interface exploits an extension of the 
Cooper storage mechanism that HPSG uses to account for scope ambiguities. In de 
Swart and Sag (2002), all negative quantifiers are collected into an N-store, and are 
interpreted by means of iteration (double negation) or resumption (negative concord) 
upon retrieval. This puts the ambiguity between single and double negation readings 
in the grammar, rather than in the lexical items. This paper extends the earlier analysis 
with a typology of negation and negative indefinites using bi-directional optimality 
theory (OT). The constraints defined are universal, but their ranking varies from one 
language to the next. In negative concord languages, the functional motivation for the 
marking of 'negative variables' wins out, so we use n-words. Double negation 
languages value first-order iteration, so we use plain indefinites or negative polarity 
items within the scope of negation. The bi-directional set-up is essential, for syntactic 
and semantic variation go hand in hand.


Egg, Markus # # Universität Saarbrücken # Mismatches at the syntax-semantics interface # 2004-10-01 # #
Recent analyses of mismatches at the syntax-semantics interface 
investigate e.g. modification of agentive nouns (Larson, 1998), 
modification of quantifying pronouns (Abney, 1987), or recursive 
modification (Kasper, to appear). Each of these analyses is tailored 
to a specific set of data, and it is not immediately obvious how 
they could be generalised to cover a larger set of data. 
I propose a unified analysis for these mismatches that attempts to 
bring out their common ground. This analysis shares some of its 
basic intuitions with the one of Kasper, but is more general because 
the mismatches are handled locally in the CONT feature. Its pivot is 
an elaborate syntax-semantics interface that is based on a 
surface-oriented syntactic analysis. This analysis generalises 
easily to the mismatches at the morphology-semantics interface for 
German separable-prefix verbs that were discussed in <a href=http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/paradox.html>(Müller, 2003)</a>.

This paper discusses support in the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al
2002) for describing semantic selection.  We first distinguish between
defeasible semantic constraints and `grammaticized' semantic selection
which actually pertains to grammaticality/ungrammaticality.  We argue
that the operation of unification is only appropriate to the latter,
and therefore only support the latter in the Matrix.  Our overall
strategy is to license all grammatical sentences, even unlikely ones,
while ruling out ungrammatical strings.  There are two mechanisms of
semantic selection, corresponding to the semantic and syntactic head
paths: a feature SORT on indices and a feature KEY inside HEAD.

Ginzburg, Jonathan # 0000-0001-5737-0991 # King's College London # HPSG in Constructive Type Theory # 2004-10-01 # no #
In the talk I propose, following the lead of some recent work by Robin Cooper
(Cooper (2005a,b)), that Constructive Type Theory (CTT, Ranta (1994), see also
Constable (2002) for a elementary introduction) is an attractive framework to underpin HPSG.
<P>
    HPSG is a framework in which detailed and explicit analysis of a wide range of
linguistic phenomena in several languages have been carried out. One of the virtues
of the framework is that it allows for a transparent computational implementation
of many of its theoretical analyses. Moreover, certain features of HPSG's architecture 
make it an attractive choice for underpinning one of the early 21st century's
growth areas for theoretical and applied linguistic research, namely language use
in dialogue.
<P>
    And yet, HPSG is at present saddled with a number of problematic theoretical 
entities and mechanisms which hinder this development. Chief among these, I
will suggest, are the use of typed feature structures (TFSs) as the basic representational 
entity of the linguistic ontology and unification as the combinatorial glue of
TFSs. Briefly, the problem with using unification is that it often involves postulating
semantic identity between a daughter&mdash;the head daughter typically&mdash;and its
mother, an assumption I demonstrate is untenable. TFSs are problematic, at least
for semantic analysis, on a number of grounds: they simulate rather than directly
constitute semantic entities; given this, building and manipulating functions in the
semantic domain&mdash;the bread and butter of much semantic analysis&mdash;is difficult to
accomplish. Moreover, for certain analytic purposes I discuss one needs to have
available entities both at the level of types and the actual domain (including utterance)
tokens. Existing formalizations of HPSG, with one exception I am aware of,
are formulated either in terms of tokens O R, more recently, types, and so do not
make both readily available.
<p>
    In this talk, which surveys work from Ginzburg (2005a,b), I sketch an alternative 
foundation for HPSG, which avoids problems such as the ones hinted above,
and which can serve as a source for fruitful synthesis of a number of research programs. 
There has been a fair amount of interest in using constructive type theory
as a foundation for NL semantics (see e.g. Fernando (2001); Krahmer and Piwek
(1999)). It offers theoretically elegant accounts of anaphora and quantificational
phenomena on which much semantic work has been invested in frameworks such
as Discourse Representation Theory and Dynamic Semantics. In the paper referenced 
above, Robin Cooper has shown that CTT can serve as a unifying framework
for Montague Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, Situation Semantics,
and HPSG.
<p>
     After introducing the basics of CTT, I discuss three main application areas:
ontology, grammatical description, and dialogue processing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>       Ontology: I show that CTT allows us to recast the semantic ontology developed in Ginzburg and Sag (2000). In the latter work, non-well-founded set
       theory (using tools developed by Seligman and Moss (1997)) was employed
       as logical framework. CTT, arguably, provides a simpler, more 
       `independently motivated' formulation.
<li>   Grammatical Description: I discuss data from ellipsis in dialogue that
       favours using -abstraction and application as tools for semantic compo-
       sition over (head-driven) unification.
<li>       Dialogue Processing: I argue that HPSG<sub>CCT</sub> is well equipped to serve as
       a theory of utterance processing in dialogue. In particular, it allows for
       a straightforward formulation of partial understanding and clarification requests.                                                    
</ul>

The Russian data presented in Perlmutter and Moore (2002) seem to
call into question the standard analysis of raising within Head-driven Phrase
Structure Grammar (HPSG): In Russian, the case marking of the raising target 
and raising pivot does not seem to be shared. In this paper, we show that
the phenomena described by Perlmutter and Moore can receive another analysis, 
fully compatible with HPSG's theory of raising. We argue in addition
that our account leads to a slightly simpler model of the Russian data than
Perlmutter and Moore's. Crucially, our analysis is only available if we avail
ourselves of a rich network of language-specific constructional schemata, a
stance recently advocated within HPSG, following the lead of Construction
Grammar.

In this paper I present two classes of double object constructions in Modern 
Greek, i.e., the genitive, as well as the double accusative, ditransitive 
constructions. I show that these two classes differ from one another in that 
not both of them permit derivational processes such as the formation of 
adjectival passives. I also look at the case properties associated with the 
verbs which head Modern Greek genitive and double accusative ditransitive 
constructions. Finally, the analysis I propose for these constructions in 
Modern Greek are formalized using the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) 
framework of Copestake et al. (2001) and Copestake et al. (2003).


Maekawa, Takafumi # # University of Essex # Constituency, word order and focus projection # 2004-10-17 # #
In this study we show that constituency is of limited importance for a proper treatment of 
the interaction between the linear position of a wa-marked nominal in a Japanese sentence 
and possible domains of contrastive focus, and that constraints concerning contrastive focus 
should be represented in terms of linear order and not constituency.  Linearisation HPSG, 
where linear order is independent from constituency, provides a good basis for an analysis.  
Some constraints are provided in terms of order domains, and it is shown that these 
constraints can deal with the phenomena in question, and that the cases problematic for the 
constituency-based analyses can also be accounted for by our analysis.


Marshall, Ian  & Safar, Eva # & # University of East Anglia # Sign language generation in an ALE HPSG # 2004-10-18 # #
During the past fifty years sign languages have been
recognised as genuine languages with their own syntax and
distinctive phonology. In the case of sign languages,
phonetic description characterises the manual and
non-manual aspects of signing. The latter relate to facial
expression and upper torso position. In the case of manual
components these characterise hand shape, orientation and
position, and hand/arm movement in three dimensional space
around the signer's body. These phonetic charcaterisations
can be notated as HamNoSys descriptions of signs which has
an executable interpretation to drive an avatar.
<p>
The HPSG sign language generation component of a text to
sign language system prototype is described. The
assimilation of SL morphological features to generate signs
which respect positional agreement in signing space are
emphasised.


Müller, Stefan # 0000-0003-4413-5313 # Universität Bremen # An analysis of depictive secondary predicates in German without discontinuous constituents # 2004-08-11 # #    
In <a href="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/mehr-vf-lb.html">Müller, 2005</a> I provide evidence that suggests that linearization approaches
that analyze German clause structure with discontinuous constituents
cannot account for the German clause structure in an insightful way. 
In order to eliminate the very powerful concept of linearization
domains and discontinuous constituents from the grammar,
analyses of other phenomena which also rely on discontinuous constituents should therefore
be revised. 
<p>
In this paper, I develop an analysis of German depictive secondary predicates
that differs from the one suggested in <a href="http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/complex.html">Müller, 2002</a> by assuming binary branching structures,
verb movment, and continuous constituents instead of a linearization approach. Some shortcomings of previous analyses are pointed
out and it is shown how linearization constraints regarding depictive predicate and antecedent
can be modeled.

According to standard assumptions of most generative theories, both
Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan, raising and so-called Exceptional Case
Marking constructions, but not control constructions, should allow for
case transmission, i.e., the identity of the grammatical case between
the higher element (raised element, controller), and the lower element
(trace/copy, controlled PRO).  This prediction is not fulfilled for
many languages, including Czech and Polish, where, e.g., case
transmission is allowed from subjects, whether they are raised
elements or controllers.  Building on earlier observations by Hudson
1998 concerning similar facts in Icelandic and Ancient Greek, we
propose an explicit and precise account of case transmission in
control and raising constructions which builds on the standard
(Pollard and Sag 1994) HPSG approach to control and raising and on an
earlier independently motivated analysis of syntactic case assignment
(Przepiórkowski 1999).  It turns out that only minor additions to
these two grammar modules are required to successfully account for the
curious case transmission facts in Czech and Polish.

Japanese is often taken to be strictly head-final in its syntax. In our work on
a broad-coverage, precision implemented HPSG for Japanese, we have found that
while this is generally true, there are nonetheless a few minor exceptions to
the broad trend. In this paper, we describe the grammar engineering project,
present the exceptions we have found, and conclude that this kind of phenomenon
motivates on the one hand the HPSG type hierarchical approach which allows for
the statement of both broad generalizations and exceptions to those
generalizations and on the other hand the usefulness of grammar engineering as
a means of testing linguistic hypotheses.


Soehn, Jan-Philipp # # University of Jena # License to coll: How to bind bound words and readings to their contexts # 2004-09-30 # #
In this contribution we propose a new module for handling idioms and
distributional idiosyncrasies. Based on the concept by Richter/Sailer (1999)
the new feature COLL (context of lexical licensing) plays the central role in
our approach. We provide a way to handle decomposable and nondecomposable
idioms and idioms containing bound words. Our module guarantees the
co-occurrence of all idiom parts and of bound word and licensing context,
respectively. A prerequisite for our analysis is a means to select for
particular elements in the lexicon. We introduce another feature, LISTEME,
which gives each lexical item its unique identifier andmakes it possible to
select for a particular lexical word or phrase. Finally, we compare our
proposal with alternative approaches and give some ideas regarding further
applications beyond idiomaticity.


Taghvaipour, Mehran A. # # University of Essex # An HPSG analysis of Persian relative clauses # 2004-10-15 # #
Relative clauses (RCs) in Persian are head-modifying constituents, all
typically introduced by the invariant complementizer ke. Persian RCs are
Unbounded Dependency Constructions (UDCs), containing either a gap or a
resumptive pronoun (RP). In some positions only gaps are allowed, and in other
positions only RPs. There are also some positions where both gaps and RPs are
alternatively allowed. Illustrating the striking similarities between Persian
gaps and RPs, I will provide an HPSG unified approach to take care of the
dependency between the licensing structure and the gap/RP with a single
mechanism, using only the SLASH feature. Similar to Pollard and Sag s (1994)
approach to the bottom of the dependency, I will assume a special sign at the
bottom. However, my sign may have a nonempty PHON value. I will introduce a
feature called GAPTYPE which is a NONLOCAL feature whose value can be either
trace or rp. I will introduce two constraints to capture the pattern of
distribution of RPs and traces. At the top of the dependency, I will bind the
nonempty SLASH at the complementizer point. I will propose a lexical entry for
the complementizer ke that will account for the binding of SLASH by the feature
BIND, which has a nonempty set as value.


Trawinski, Beata # # University of Tübingen # Towards licensing of adverbial noun phrases in HPSG # 2004-10-15 # #
This paper focuses on aspects of the licensing of adverbial noun phrases
(AdvNPs) in the HPSG grammar framework. In the first part, empirical issues
will be discussed. A number of AdvNPs will be examined with respect to various
linguistic phenomena in order to find out to what extent AdvNPs share syntactic
and semantic properties with non-adverbial NPs.Based on empirical
generalizations, a lexical constraint for licensing both AdvNPs and
non-adverbial NPs will be provided. Further on, problems of structural
licensing of phrases containing AdvNPs that arise within the standard HPSG
framework of Pollard and Sag (1994) will be pointed out, and a possible
solution will be proposed. The objective is to provide a constraint-based
treatment of NPs which describes non-redundantly both their adverbial and
non-adverbial usages. The analysis proposed in this paper applies lexical and
phrasal implicational constraints and does not require any radical
modifications or extensions of the standard HPSG geometry of Pollard and Sag
(1994).

Van Eynde, Frank # 0000-0002-6172-442X # Universiteit Leuven # Pied piping is a local dependency # 2004-10-15 # #
To model the pied piping in interrogative and exclamative clauses Ginzburg & Sag (2000) proposes a
nonlocal head-driven treatment, thus emphasizing the resemblances with extraction. This treatment
has a number of drawbacks: it relies on poorly motivated lexical rules and nonbranching phrase
structure rules, it makes false predictions about pied piping in PPs, and it presupposes an
implausible structure for NPs with predeterminers.  To solve these problems I propose an alternative
in which pied piping is treated as a local functor-driven dependency.  Technically, the WH feature
is integrated in the CATEGORY objects, and the propagation of its values is modeled by constraints
which are independently needed for the treatment of other phenomena.


Yatabe, Shûichi # 0000-0003-2092-6073 # University of Tokyo # A comprehensive theory of coordination of unlikes # 2004-10-15 # #
The principal aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive theory of
coordination of unlikes, i.e., a theory that is capable of dealing with
every phenomenon resulting from coordination of unlikes.
The proposed theory accounts not just for standard cases of coordination
of unlike arguments and coordination of unlike functors but also for cases
involving single-conjunct agreement and what will be called each-conjunct agreement.
In the course of the argumentation, it is also shown that, even in a language like English,
predicate-argument agreement needs to be described in terms of a relational
constraint that is not simply an identity requirement.
