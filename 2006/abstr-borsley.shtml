<p>
Languages often require negation to be realized in a prominent position. A well
known example is Italian, which seems to require a pre-verbal realization of
negation. Some other languages require negation to be in a prominent position
but do not require it to be pre-verbal. An example is Swedish. Working within
Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), Sells (2000) proposes that Swedish requires a
negative element which is not inside VP and that Italian has the same
constraint. Similar facts are found in the VSO language Welsh. However,
Sellss approach cannot be applied to Welsh. Borsley and Jones (2005)
develop a selectional approach to Welsh, in which certain verbs require a
negative complement. This works well for Welsh but cannot be applied to Swedish
or Italian. A similar approach to all three languages is possible within the
linearization-based version of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
developed by Kathol (2000). It seems, then, that a linear approach is
preferable to both a structural and a selectional approach.
