</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Locality in sentence processing is the assumption that integrating dependents and heads involves a 
processing cost that is some function of the distance between them. Locality stands at the heart of a
 major open problem in sentence processing: how are words assembled in real time by the human parsing
 mechanism to form syntactic parses? Cross-linguistic experimental research on locality has led to 
fairly diverse theoretical positions, but the final picture is still far from clear. In my talk, I 
present a series of self-paced reading and eyetracking experimental studies of English, Chinese, 
German, and Hindi that my collaborators and I have recently conducted, and relate these to the 
different predictions of three distinct computational models of locality&ndash;dependency locality 
theory (Gibson 2000), surprisal (Hale 2001), and cue-based parsing (Lewis and Vasishth 2005, 
Vasishth and Lewis 2007).
