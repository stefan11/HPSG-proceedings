<div class="blurb"
<p>
In Modern Greek there is a rich aspectual system, which involves both
morphologically expressed grammatical aspect and eventuality types, carried
primarily by the meaning of the verbal predicate. Particular emphasis is paid
to the interaction between grammatical aspect and eventuality types, since it
is due to this interaction that the verbal predicate acquires distinct
meanings. In order to explain potential changes in the meaning of the
eventualities caused by the interaction with grammatical aspect, I propose a
formal analysis within HPSG, using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) for the
semantic representations. Following the MRS architecture, I introduce a number
of relations, which represent both grammatical aspect and eventuality
types. The close interaction between grammatical aspect and eventuality types
triggers special meanings which traditionally can be explained by inserting
contextual information into the representations. In this paper, I argue against
such an analysis, providing an alternative which is  based on the introduction
of subeventual templates formulated by Michaelis (2003) and Pustejovsky
(1995). In this context, grammatical aspect combines with eventuality types and
selects eventualities or subeventualities appropriate to its selection
restrictions, using information that is already there in the denotation of the
eventualities.
