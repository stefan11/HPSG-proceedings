Conventional wisdom holds that productive morphology is regular
morphology. Drawing evidence from French, we argue that the description of many
lexeme formation processes is simplified if we hold that a productive rule may
give rise to inflectionally irregular lexemes. We argue that the notion of a
<i>stem space</i> allows for a straightforward description of this phenomenon:
each lexeme comes equipped with a vector of possibly distinct stems, which
serve as bases for inflectional form construction. The stem space is structured
by default relations which encode the regular pattern of inflection; (partial)
irregularities occur when a lexeme specifies a stem space violating the default
relations. Derived irregularity is then the effect of a productive lexeme
formation rule which specifies an irregular stem space for its output.

The "flexibility" of gender in Tigrinya is uncovered by (i) setting a value
for gender for each noun at the lexical level (i.e. <em>bare</em> controllers) and (ii)
analysing  gender shifts as signals for evaluations (i.e. <em>evaluated</em>
controllers). The analysis is formalized as lexical rules which change the
value of <font style="font-variant:small-caps;">gend</font> and add an elementary predication in the  <font style="font-variant:small-caps;">rels</font> list.

Russian shows the mixed agreement with the polite pronoun <em>vy</em> and pluralia
tantum nouns, both of which have plural number in form but either singular
or plural number in meaning. Two different forms of adjectives &ndash; short form
and long form &ndash; agree in different number with those number mismatch
nominals.  
<p>
I adopted the idea of Siegel (1976) etc. that when a long-form adjective
appears in the predicate position, there is always a null head that it
modifies, with the HPSG's agreement theory of Wechsler &amp; Zlatic (2003). I
propose that all predicates &ndash; verbs, SF and LF adjectives &ndash; except
predicate nominals show CONCORD agreement. LF adjectives show CONC
agreement with the null anaphor 'one'. The different number values of LF
adjectives results from index agreement between the null anaphor and the
subject of the sentence.

In this contribution we will argue that negative polarity is a collocational
phenomenon that does not follow from other properties of the respective lexical
elements. With German data as evidence, we will follow a proposal by van der
Wouden and treat Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) as collocates which must be
licensed by abstract semantic properties of their contexts. Using a collocation
module for HPSG, which has been independently motivated for bound words and
idioms, we will show how to restrict the occurrence of NPIs to legitimate
environments, starting from the negativity hierarchy of licensing environments
by Zwarts. Besides a more fine-grained semantic licenser hierarchy, we will
establish syntactic licensing domains and general collocational restrictions of
NPIs.

This paper proposes a projectionist account of the unexpressed object
alternations in HPSG. The approach is based on the two-level mapping mechanism,
developed in Manning and Sag (1998) and Sag et al (2003). The proposed analysis
keeps identical argument structure values in the lexeme description of both
valence alternatives, while different surface valence values are related by a
lexical rule.
<p>
The HPSG model is applied cross-linguistically to English and Bulgarian. Some
Bulgarian-specific traits, such as the limited alternation range and the
grammaticalized aspect, related to the formal characteristics of the
unexpressed object alternations, are discussed and interpreted within HPSG.
