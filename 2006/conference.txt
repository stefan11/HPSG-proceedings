Comparative correlative (CC) constructions have received much attention in
recent years. Major issues have been whether they involve special constructions
and whether they have symmetric or asymmetric structures. Evidence from Romance
suggests that they require special constructions and that they may be either
symmetric or asymmetric. French has a single construction which is asymmetric
for some speakers and symmetric for others. Spanish has two distinct
constructions, one asymmetric and the other symmetric with quite different
properties. The facts can be accommodated in a straightforward way within
construction-based HPSG.

Abstract: A functional typology of copular <q>be</q> in Russian allows us to
systematically relate variants of predication with and without copula. The
analysis sketched in this article does not need empty categories; neither does
it have to stipulate categories, category changes or constituents that are not
morphologically signalled. With regard to HPSG formalization, the presented
approach independently motivates the use of features and mechanisms that
are already available in this framework.

This paper proposes a new approach to the prosody-syntax interface in
HPSG. Previous approaches to prosody in HPSG (Klein, 2000; Haji-Abdolhosseini,
2003) represent prosodic information by constructing metrical constituent
structure in the tradition of (Selkirk, 1980; Liberman and Prince, 1977). One
drawback of this approach is that it does not allow for a direct representation
of purely metrical constraints, which are relegated to an unformalized
performance component. By contrast, so called 'grid only' approaches (Prince,
1983; Selkirk, 1984; Delais-Roussarie, 2000) use a single data structure, a
<i>metrical grid</i>, to encode prosodic constraints resulting from syntax and
constraints of a rhythmic nature.</p>
<p>We first review relevant data from French showing that prosodic constituency
is much less constrained by syntactic structure than is predicted by existing
approaches. In all but very short utterances, many different prosodic groupings
are possible for a given sentence with a determinate information structure, and
rhythmic factors determine a preference ordering on the possible groupings. We
then present an HPSG implementation of the metrical grid, and propose minimal
syntactic constraints on relative prominence, leaving room for noncategorical
rythmic constraints to choose between alternatives. We finish by discussing the
interaction of the metrical grid with the rest of the prosodic grammar.</p>


Borsley, Robert D. # 0000-0002-4856-4732 # University of Essex # A linear approach to negative prominence # 2006-10-15 # #
Languages often require negation to be realized in a prominent position. A well
known example is Italian, which seems to require a pre-verbal realization of
negation. Some other languages require negation to be in a prominent position
but do not require it to be pre-verbal. An example is Swedish. Working within
Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), Sells (2000) proposes that Swedish requires a
negative element which is not inside VP and that Italian has the same
constraint. Similar facts are found in the VSO language Welsh. However,
Sellss approach cannot be applied to Welsh. Borsley and Jones (2005)
develop a selectional approach to Welsh, in which certain verbs require a
negative complement. This works well for Welsh but cannot be applied to Swedish
or Italian. A similar approach to all three languages is possible within the
linearization-based version of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
developed by Kathol (2000). It seems, then, that a linear approach is
preferable to both a structural and a selectional approach.


Branco, António & Costa, Francisco # 0000-0002-7174-4942 & mailed # University of Lisbon # Noun ellipsis without empty categories # 2006-10-15 # #
In this paper, we present an analysis of noun phrases with elided
nouns that dispenses with the positing of empty categories and
preserves the NP structure assumed for NPs with overt nouns, modulo
the absence of the head noun. On a par with existing traceless analyses of
long distance dependencies, this is proposed as a further step
towards a more lean theory of grammar, without phonetically null items.

Chaves, Rui P. # 0000-0003-0820-6145 # Centro de Linguística da Universidade de Lisboa # Coordination of unlikes without unlike categories # 2006-10-15 # #
Several analysis of Coordination of Unlikes have  been proposed within the HPSG framework.
In some of these approaches the possible combinations of 'unlike categories' are encoded in 
the grammar, while other accounts resort to an independently motivated ellipsis analysis.
In this paper we provide further arguments in favor of the latter. However, some problematic 
cases of Coordination of Unlikes in certain S-adjoining constructions are left unaccounted for. 
We propose a general analysis of these S-adjoining constructions, and in doing so, 
the problematic coordination cases are predicted without the need for further assumptions.


Crysmann, Berthold # 0000-0003-0230-502X # German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) & Saarland University # Floating affixes in Polish # 2006-10-17 # #
The morphosyntactic status of Polish past tense agreement markers has
been a matter of considerable debate in recent years
(Spencer 1991, Borsley &amp; Rivero 1994,
Borsley 1999, Bański 2000, Kupść 2000, Kupść &amp; Tseng 2005). Past tense
agreement is expressed by a set of bound forms that either attach to
the past participle, or else <q>float off</q> to a host further to the
left. Despite this relative freedom of attachment, it is often noted
in the literature, e.g., Borsley 1999, Kupść &amp; Tseng 2005, that
the combination of verbal host and agreement marker forms a word-like
unit.
<p>
In this paper I will argue that these agreement markers are best
analysed as affixes uniformly introduced on the verb whose
inflectional features they realise. Building on the
linearisation-based theory of morphology-syntax interaction proposed
in Crysmann 2003, syntactic mobility of morphologically
introduced material will be captured by mapping phonological
contributions to multiple lexically introduced domain objects. It will
be shown that this is sufficient to capture the relevant data, and
connect the placement of floating <q>affixes</q> to the general treatment
of Polish word order Kupść 2000.


Flouraki, Maria # mailed # University of Essex # Constraining aspectual composition # 2006-10-12 # #
In Modern Greek there is a rich aspectual system, which involves both
morphologically expressed grammatical aspect and eventuality types, carried
primarily by the meaning of the verbal predicate. Particular emphasis is paid
to the interaction between grammatical aspect and eventuality types, since it
is due to this interaction that the verbal predicate acquires distinct
meanings. In order to explain potential changes in the meaning of the
eventualities caused by the interaction with grammatical aspect, I propose a
formal analysis within HPSG, using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) for the
semantic representations. Following the MRS architecture, I introduce a number
of relations, which represent both grammatical aspect and eventuality
types. The close interaction between grammatical aspect and eventuality types
triggers special meanings which traditionally can be explained by inserting
contextual information into the representations. In this paper, I argue against
such an analysis, providing an alternative which is  based on the introduction
of subeventual templates formulated by Michaelis (2003) and Pustejovsky
(1995). In this context, grammatical aspect combines with eventuality types and
selects eventualities or subeventualities appropriate to its selection
restrictions, using information that is already there in the denotation of the
eventualities.

Since Pollard and Sag (1994) it has been assumed that raising involves full
structure sharing, whereas a control verb merely shares the content of one of
the lower verb's arguments. This has been considered a property of the
phenomena, despite the fact that Pollard and Sag (1994) present this syntactic
difference as a hypothesis confirmed for Icelandic only. In this paper we
discuss the difference between raising and control from the perspective of
Dutch and German passives. It has already been shown by Van Noord and Kordoni
(2005) that the secondary object passives in these languages are raising
structures, in which the case of the raised argument changes. In this paper we
provide additional evidence for the raising analysis, and we propose a new
analysis, which allows for a uniform account of Dutch and German passives as
raising structures. Przepiorkowski and Rosen (2004) show that control may
exhibit case transmission; the data presented in this paper shows that raising
may not. Therefore, we claim that the distinction between raising and control
is found in theta-role assignment. Syntactically they tend to behave
differently, but they may also behave in the exact same way.


Godard, Danièle & Marandin, Jean-Marie # mailed & mailed # CNRS, Université Paris 7 # Reinforcing negation: The case of Italian # 2006-10-15 # #
We study the formal and pragmatic properties of the `reinforced negation
construction' in Italian, which, unlike the regular negative sentence, contains
both <em>non</em> and an n-word in preverbal position. On the one hand, this
construction relies on a more general construction (positive or negative),
which is pragmatically associated with reprise assertion, on the other hand, it
uses <em>non</em> without the usual constraints attached to it. We propose that this
unfaithful recycling is a pattern for creating a form dedicated to
metalinguistic negation. Our analysis integrates both negative types of
negative forms with their formal and pragmatic properties.

American Sign Language (ASL) has a group of verbs showing agreement with the
subject or/and object argument. There has not been analysis on especially
number agreement. This paper analyzes person and number agreement within the
HPSG framework. I discuss person and number hierarchy in ASL. The argument of
agreement verbs can be omitted as in languages like Italian. The constraints on
the type agreement-verb have the information on argument optionality.


Maekawa, Takafumi # mailed # Department of Language and Linguistics University of Essex # Long and short adjunct fronting in HPSG # 2006-10-15 # #
The purpose of this paper is to consider the proper treatment of short- and
long-fronted adjuncts within HPSG.  In the earlier HPSG analyses, a rigid
link between linear order and constituent structure determines the linear
position of such adjuncts in the sentence-initial position.  This paper will
argue that there is a body of data which suggests that adjunct fronting does
not work as these approaches predict.  I will then show that
linearisation-based HPSG can provide a fairly straightforward account of the
facts.


Melnik, Nurit # 0000-0002-0610-915X # University of Haifa # Hybrid agreement as a conflict resolution strategy # 2006-10-15 # #
Situations in which conflicting constraints clash can potentially provide
linguists with insights into the architecture of grammar. This paper deals with
such a case. When predicative modifiers of morphologically rich languages head
relative clauses, they are involved in two, sometimes conflicting, agreement
relationships. Different languages adopt different strategies in order to
resolve situations of conflicting constraints. This paper focuses on Standard
Arabic and the hybrid agreement strategy which it employs. It argues that the
HPSG theory of agreement, which distinguishes between morphosyntactic and
semantic agreement, constitutes an appropriate framework for accounting for the
phenomenon. In addition, it shows that contrary to claims made by Doron and
Reintges (2005), a non-derivational framework such as HPSG is adequate for
accounting for this non-trivial agreement pattern. Moreover, with a
constructional approach, whereby constraints can target syntactic structures
above the lexical level, better empirical coverage is achieved.

It has often been argued that Non-Constituent Coordinations involve
ellipsis. Focussing in this paper on so-called 'Argument Cluster Coordination',
we provide empirical evidence drawn from French against such elliptical
analyses. We then sketch an alternative approach within HPSG, allowing
non-standard constituents to be conjoined in the scope of some shared
predicate. While such non-standard constituents are generally obtained by
relaxing phrase structure, we propose analyzing them as non-headed
constructions, deriving their unusual properties from the interplay of two
different sets of constraints: those imposed by coordination and those imposed
by predicates that select such clusters as arguments.


Müller, Stefan # 0000-0003-4413-5313 # Universität Bremen/ Universität Potsdam # Persian complex predicates and the limits of inheritance-based analyses # 2006-10-01 # no #
Persian complex predicates pose an interesting challenge for theoretical
linguistics, since they have both word-like and phrase-like properties. For
instance, they can feed derivational processes, but they are also separable by
the future auxiliary or the negation prefix. 
<p>
Various proposals have been made in the literature to capture the nature of
Persian complex predicates, among them analyses that treat them on a purely
phrasal basis or purely in the lexicon. Mixed analyses that analyze them as
words per default and as phrases in the non-default case were also suggested. 
<p>
In the talk I show that theories that exclusively rely on classification
of patterns in inheritance hierarchies cannot account for the facts in an
insightful way unless they are augmented by transformations or similar
devices. I then show that a lexical account together with appropriate ID
schemata and an argument attraction analysis of the future auxiliary has none
of the shortcomings that classification-based analyses have and that it can
account for both the phrasal and the word-like properties of Persian complex
predicates.


Nakanishi, Katsuaki # mailed # Department of Language and Information Sciences University of Tokyo # A unified approach to questions, quantifiers, and
coordination in Japanese # 2006-10-14 # #
The Japanese language is one of the languages where universal and
existential quantification are expressed using wh-words with the
conjunctive and disjunctive particles, respectively. In this paper,
inspired by the syntactic and semantic parallelism found in Japanese
between quantification, coordination, and question, we seek to analyze
these constructions in a unified fashion. We investigate various
phenomena of these constructions and show how these three constructions
can be uniformly analyzed as cases where abstracted arguments are
questioned or quantified for verbs. We then present an HPSG
formalization of the analysis.

This paper attempts to decompose the Motion event into such elements as Figure,
Path, Vector, and Ground based upon Talmy's framework, which makes it possible
to formally analyze and compare the lexical semantics of the deictic motion
verbs within and across languages.  It is shown that the difference in
interpretations of the Path is attributable to the lexical specifications of
both deictic motion verbs and locative phrases.  It is argued that deictic
motion verbs can be lexically specified for the entailment of arrival only if
they express the Path eventually directed to the deictic center.  A formal
analysis is given based upon the HPSG framework in order to identify the
elements of a Motion event contributed by each element of a verb phrase, and to
determine the compositional fashion in which they are combined to give the
interpretation of the verb phrase as a whole.

exceptions within a given language.


Sato, Yo # mailed # Department of Computer Science King's College London # A proposed lexicalised linearisation grammar: A monostratal alternative # 2006-10-08 # #
This paper presents an overview of a proposed linearisation grammar, which
relies solely upon information residing in lexical heads to constrain word
order. Word order information, which encompasses discontinuity as well as
linear precedence conditions, is explicitly encoded as part of the feature
structure of lexical heads, thus dispensing with a separate LP specification or
`phenogrammatical' layer standardly posited for linearisation. Instead, such
lexicon-originated word order constraints are enforced in projections,
propagated upwards and accumulated in the compound PHON feature, which
represents phonological yields in an underspecified manner. Though limited
somewhat in generative capacity, this approach covers the key phenomena that
motivated linearisation grammars and offers a simpler alternative to the
standard DOM-oriented theory.


Tily, Harry J. & Sag, Ivan A. # mailed & no # Department of Linguistics, Stanford University # A unified analysis of French causatives # 2006-10-18 # #
The treatment of French causatives and pronominal affixes outlined in Miller
and Sag (1997) and Abeill&eacute; et al. (1998) is notable for its
comprehensive coverage and analytic detail, but it relies on a number of <i>ad
hoc</i> features and types that have little empirical justification. We sketch
a new treatment of the same data set, which eliminates multiple lexical entries
for the causative, as well as a number of other undesirable analytic
devices. Our account builds on a long-standing observation that seeming
irregularities in the system of case assignment to the <q>causee</q> of <i>faire</i>
are not in fact exceptional, but determined by the general case assignment
behavior of transitive verbs. This generalization, first incorporated into an
HPSG analysis by Bratt (1990), was abandoned in subsequent HPSG work that
sought to expand the coverage of French beyond that of Bratt's analysis. Our
goal here is to show that broad coverage need not come at the expense of
linguistically significant generalizations.

Locality in sentence processing is the assumption that integrating dependents and heads involves a 
processing cost that is some function of the distance between them. Locality stands at the heart of a
 major open problem in sentence processing: how are words assembled in real time by the human parsing
 mechanism to form syntactic parses? Cross-linguistic experimental research on locality has led to 
fairly diverse theoretical positions, but the final picture is still far from clear. In my talk, I 
present a series of self-paced reading and eyetracking experimental studies of English, Chinese, 
German, and Hindi that my collaborators and I have recently conducted, and relate these to the 
different predictions of three distinct computational models of locality&ndash;dependency locality 
theory (Gibson 2000), surprisal (Hale 2001), and cue-based parsing (Lewis and Vasishth 2005, 
Vasishth and Lewis 2007).
