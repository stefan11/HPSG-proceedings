</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Persian complex predicates pose an interesting challenge for theoretical
linguistics, since they have both word-like and phrase-like properties. For
instance, they can feed derivational processes, but they are also separable by
the future auxiliary or the negation prefix. 
<p>
Various proposals have been made in the literature to capture the nature of
Persian complex predicates, among them analyses that treat them on a purely
phrasal basis or purely in the lexicon. Mixed analyses that analyze them as
words per default and as phrases in the non-default case were also suggested. 
<p>
In the talk I show that theories that exclusively rely on classification
of patterns in inheritance hierarchies cannot account for the facts in an
insightful way unless they are augmented by transformations or similar
devices. I then show that a lexical account together with appropriate ID
schemata and an argument attraction analysis of the future auxiliary has none
of the shortcomings that classification-based analyses have and that it can
account for both the phrasal and the word-like properties of Persian complex
predicates.
