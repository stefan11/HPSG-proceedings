</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
This paper attempts to decompose the Motion event into such elements as Figure,
Path, Vector, and Ground based upon Talmy's framework, which makes it possible
to formally analyze and compare the lexical semantics of the deictic motion
verbs within and across languages.  It is shown that the difference in
interpretations of the Path is attributable to the lexical specifications of
both deictic motion verbs and locative phrases.  It is argued that deictic
motion verbs can be lexically specified for the entailment of arrival only if
they express the Path eventually directed to the deictic center.  A formal
analysis is given based upon the HPSG framework in order to identify the
elements of a Motion event contributed by each element of a verb phrase, and to
determine the compositional fashion in which they are combined to give the
interpretation of the verb phrase as a whole.
