A workshop about <em>Regularity and Irregularity in Grammar and Language</em>
was attached to the conference. It featured one invited talk
and 5 papers, selected by the program committee.
<p>
In total there were 39 submissions to the main conference and  submissions to the
workshop. 
We want to thank the respective program committee for putting this nice program together.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Thanks go to Kiril Simov and Petya Osenova, who were in charge of local arrangements.
<p>
<p>
As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.
<p>
<p>
The proceedings include all the papers except those by Stefan Müller, Shravan Vasishth, and Frank
van Eynde.
<p>

The <a href="toc.shtml">table of contents</a> lists all the
papers presented at the conference. Some papers were not submitted to
the proceedings. For these papers, we suggest contacting the authors
directly.
