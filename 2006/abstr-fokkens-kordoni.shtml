</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Since Pollard and Sag (1994) it has been assumed that raising involves full
structure sharing, whereas a control verb merely shares the content of one of
the lower verb's arguments. This has been considered a property of the
phenomena, despite the fact that Pollard and Sag (1994) present this syntactic
difference as a hypothesis confirmed for Icelandic only. In this paper we
discuss the difference between raising and control from the perspective of
Dutch and German passives. It has already been shown by Van Noord and Kordoni
(2005) that the secondary object passives in these languages are raising
structures, in which the case of the raised argument changes. In this paper we
provide additional evidence for the raising analysis, and we propose a new
analysis, which allows for a uniform account of Dutch and German passives as
raising structures. Przepiorkowski and Rosen (2004) show that control may
exhibit case transmission; the data presented in this paper shows that raising
may not. Therefore, we claim that the distinction between raising and control
is found in theta-role assignment. Syntactically they tend to behave
differently, but they may also behave in the exact same way.
