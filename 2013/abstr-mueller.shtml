<h1 class="smalL">Müller, Gereon: Derivational Syntax: Arguments and Challenges
</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
Strong arguments for a derivational organization of syntax are
provided by opaque interactions of grammatical building blocks (like
rules, constraints, or schemata), i.e., by counter-bleeding and
counter-feeding phenomena. Some of these opaque interactions can be
captured in declarative/representational approaches by enriching
representations (e.g., by traces/copies), others less
straightforwardly so, and some not at all.
<p>
Arguments for extremely small local domains in derivational syntax (as
in phase theory) are typically based on conceptual considerations
(economy, learnability), but they can also be empirical in nature:
Assuming a larger accessible domain (for syntactic rules/constraints),
a wrong output would be predicted.
<p>
Assuming a derivational syntax with small accessible windows (as in
some versions of the minimalist program) leads to a restrictive
theory, but at the same time it raises potential problems. In
particular, the questions arise of (i) whether there are
meta-constraints on the order of operations (cf. Pullum (1979),
McCawley (1984), Chomsky (2013)), and (ii) how phenomena can be
addressed where it looks as though the accessible parts of a
derivation must be larger after all because crucial information that
would be needed for proper constraint/rule evaluation is otherwise
lost. On the basis of improper movement and remnant movement
constructions in German and other languages (where the two potential
problems co-occur), I will argue that this challenge can be met in a
simple way.
