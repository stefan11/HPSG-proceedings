</h1>

<p>
This paper presents a unified approach to multiple nominative and accusative constructions in
Korean. We identify 16 semantic relations holding between two consecutive NPs in multiple case
marking constructions, and propose each semantic relation as a licensing condition on double case
marking.  We argue that the multiple case marking constructions are merely the sequences of double
case marking, which are formed by dextrosinistrally sequencing the pairs of the same-case marked NPs
of same or different type. Some appealing consequences of this proposal include a new comprehensive
classification of the sequences of same-case NPs and a straightforward account of some long standing
problems such as how the additional same-case NPs are licensed, and in what respects the multiple
nominative marking and the multiple accusative marking are alike and different from each other.
