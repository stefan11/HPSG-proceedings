This paper shows how certain differences in the nature of Voice systems  across languages are responsible
for the behavior of passives, dispositional middles and also regulate the distribution of deponency.

Simpler Syntax is an approach to grammar that calls for very restrictive limits on the notion of
'grammatical competence'. Specifically, it does not account for unacceptability judgments for
sentences that are well-formed if they are fully licensed by the constructions of the language. SS
leads us to seek accounts for  such judgments in terms other than grammar per se, e.g., processing
complexity, semantic or pragmatic well-formedness, discourse coherence, etc. I review several
examples that suggest that the line that SS draws between competence on the one hand and performance
and other mechanisms on the other is on the right track. Specifically, it does not account for

focus on empty theorizing or collecting data without theoretical guidance, respectively. Schools
progress from communities in which issues can be openly discussed to communities in which certain
issues have to be agreed on to communities in which certain issues are (wrongly) taken to be
understood (and everybody is tenured and eventually dead). Methodologically, armchair linguistics
was the order of the day prior to real progress in computation power, data collection, and
experimentation. Nowadays, linguistics should rely less on armchair considerations and much more on
computational data harvesting and psycholinguistic experimentation.
<p>
To support my claim, I shall discuss picture-NP-reflexives in binding theory and and the concept of
obligatoriness throughout. 


Müller, Gereon # # University of Leipzig # Derivational syntax: {Arguments} and challenges # 2013-10-31 # no # Strong arguments for a derivational organization of syntax are
provided by opaque interactions of grammatical building blocks (like
rules, constraints, or schemata), i.e., by counter-bleeding and
counter-feeding phenomena. Some of these opaque interactions can be
captured in declarative/representational approaches by enriching
representations (e.g., by traces/copies), others less
straightforwardly so, and some not at all.
<p>
Arguments for extremely small local domains in derivational syntax (as
in phase theory) are typically based on conceptual considerations
(economy, learnability), but they can also be empirical in nature:
Assuming a larger accessible domain (for syntactic rules/constraints),
a wrong output would be predicted.
<p>
Assuming a derivational syntax with small accessible windows (as in
some versions of the minimalist program) leads to a restrictive
theory, but at the same time it raises potential problems. In
particular, the questions arise of (i) whether there are
meta-constraints on the order of operations (cf. Pullum (1979),
McCawley (1984), Chomsky (2013)), and (ii) how phenomena can be
addressed where it looks as though the accessible parts of a
derivation must be larger after all because crucial information that
would be needed for proper constraint/rule evaluation is otherwise
lost. On the basis of improper movement and remnant movement
constructions in German and other languages (where the two potential
problems co-occur), I will argue that this challenge can be met in a
simple way.

One problem of current theorizing in mainstream generative grammar (MGG) is the impressionistic use
of data (Fanselow, 2009). Another problem is that constructs that are manifested in one language or
a language class are taken as evidence for invisible structures in other languages (Chinque, 1999;
Meinunger, 2000).
<p>
Another problem of the post GB era is the explosion of theoretical variants that make incompatible
basic assumtions. This makes it very hard to get a coherent picture of where we are and of how to
combine insights from different authors/schools.
<p>
In my talk I will briefly comment on the Poverty of the Stimulus argument (Chomsky, 1971, p. 29–33;
2013, p. 39) and show that many of the claims that have been made in the past 60 years cannot be
upheld any longer in the light of results from input-based approaches to language acquisition
(e.g. Bod, 2009; Freudenthal, et. al., 2006, 2009). The consequence of this is that gramars for
particular languages have to be motivated solely by evidence from the language under
consideration. I will then discuss the approach taken in
the <a href="/Projects/CoreGram.html">CoreGram project</a>, in which crosslinguistic generalizations
are derived in a bottom-up way from grammars that are acquirable in an input-driven way.
<p>
I will compare this method to the method used in MGG and address Croft's criticism of the MGG
methodology. I will show that the bottom-up approach makes predictions and how Cinque's insights
could be integrated into HPSG grammars without stipulating irrelevant empty nodes in all languages
of the world.
<p>
As a way out of the crises I will suggest a return to the empirical basis (compare the quote
of <a href="http://ling50.mit.edu/replies/haj-ross">von Neumann's text on the state of the art in
mathematics</a>) and I consider results from corpus research, psycholinguistic/neurolinguistic
experiments relevant in this respect. I will suggest that every (book) publication should come with
a list of covered data so that it becomes possible to see whether more data is covered than in
earlier proposals. This would make results comparable and would be a strong incentive not to fall
behind what was understood already. As an example I will use again the grammars of
the <a href="/Projects/CoreGram.html">CoreGram project</a>, which are backed up by
implementations, which ensures the consistency of the formalization and yields new insights and
discoveries which would not be possible without thorough formalization and implementation. The every
growing lists of covered phenomena ensures progress and helps with systematic testing. Although
computer implementations are very helpful in veryfying complex theories, this approach does not
require it and can be used for non-computational work as well.

In this talk, I aim to show two things. First, that the <em>wh</em>-copying construction in German cannot be given a simple analysis in the dominating frameworks. And second, that the Arc Pair Grammar framework makes such a simple analysis available.
 

Stefanowitsch, Anatol # 0000-0002-8780-775X # Freie Universität Berlin # Usage, grammar and stochastic cryptotypes # # no # 
The relationship between usage and grammar is even more contentious than that between function and form. At one extreme, authors like Hoppper (1987) argue that grammar is nothing more than an emergent property of language use, at the other extreme, authors like Newmeyer (2003) argue that usage is only a fragmentary manifestation of grammar. Cognitive Grammar takes a middle ground, granting grammar an existence based in, but separate from usage (e.g. Langacker 1987). If the latter view is right, as I believe it is, then the grammatical system in place at a given time should exert a systemic pressure on usage. For example, gaps in grammatical paradigms should force (or encourage) speakers to invent usage patterns that fill these gaps; the same should be true, more generally, of  categories that are frequently observed in the grammar of human languages but happen to be missing from a particular grammar. In my talk, I will show that such patterns, which I call “stochastic cryptotypes”, can indeed be identified with the appropriate quantitative corpus-linguistic methods.

Vincent, Nigel # 0000-0002-2494-1652 # University of Manchester # Before and between theories # 2013-10-31 # no # 
In my paper, rather than consider the merits and demerits of one particular theory, I want to address three general issues, which are relevant to advocates of all theories:
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type:lower-latin !important;">	To what extent is it possible, or indeed necessary, to agree on a common vocabulary within which to couch descriptions of basic linguistic data? And should we refer to such a vocabulary as a ‘theory’, as in Dixon’s (2010) ‘Basic Linguistic Theory’, or should we consider these terms/concepts as pre-theoretical in the sense of Lyons (1977: §1.6)? For exemplification I will draw on the history of the various uses of the term ‘conative’ in recent descriptive and theoretical work (Vincent, to appear).
</li>
<li style="list-style-type:lower-latin !important;">	Should theories be arranged hierarchically with results and constructs at one level being fed into the next level, as argued in (very!) different ways by Dryer (2006) and Hornstein (2009)? Hornstein’s argument is of particular relevance to this workshop since he treats LFG, GPSG, HPSG and RG as ‘cousins’ (his term, p. viii) of GB, and suggests that Minimalism operates at a higher level than all of these. This is another version of the old problem of notational equivalence (cf Hornstein 2009: 155ff). How far is it possible to translate between theories? Are there concepts within different theories which are identical or near-identical?
</li>
<li style="list-style-type:lower-latin !important;">	This in turn relates to the issue of whether explanation is attained through the elucidation of a pattern of data in terms of a set of theoretical constructs, possibly hierarchically arranged or by appeal to external forces such as the speaker’s communicative goals, constraints on language processing, or the forces of linguistic change. A sense of the range of views within in the field on this topic can be gathered from the discussion generated around the paper by Evans & Levinson (2009).
</li>
</ol>
The discussion of points (b) and (c) will be focussed around the accounts of control that have been proposed within different theoretical frameworks.
