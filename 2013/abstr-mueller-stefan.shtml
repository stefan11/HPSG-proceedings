<p>
One problem of current theorizing in mainstream generative grammar (MGG) is the impressionistic use
of data (Fanselow, 2009). Another problem is that constructs that are manifested in one language or
a language class are taken as evidence for invisible structures in other languages (Chinque, 1999;
Meinunger, 2000).
<p>
Another problem of the post GB era is the explosion of theoretical variants that make incompatible
basic assumtions. This makes it very hard to get a coherent picture of where we are and of how to
combine insights from different authors/schools.
<p>
In my talk I will briefly comment on the Poverty of the Stimulus argument (Chomsky, 1971, p. 29–33;
2013, p. 39) and show that many of the claims that have been made in the past 60 years cannot be
upheld any longer in the light of results from input-based approaches to language acquisition
(e.g. Bod, 2009; Freudenthal, et. al., 2006, 2009). The consequence of this is that gramars for
particular languages have to be motivated solely by evidence from the language under
consideration. I will then discuss the approach taken in
the <a href="/Projects/CoreGram.html">CoreGram project</a>, in which crosslinguistic generalizations
are derived in a bottom-up way from grammars that are acquirable in an input-driven way.
<p>
I will compare this method to the method used in MGG and address Croft's criticism of the MGG
methodology. I will show that the bottom-up approach makes predictions and how Cinque's insights
could be integrated into HPSG grammars without stipulating irrelevant empty nodes in all languages
of the world.
<p>
As a way out of the crises I will suggest a return to the empirical basis (compare the quote
of <a href="http://ling50.mit.edu/replies/haj-ross">von Neumann's text on the state of the art in
mathematics</a>) and I consider results from corpus research, psycholinguistic/neurolinguistic
experiments relevant in this respect. I will suggest that every (book) publication should come with
a list of covered data so that it becomes possible to see whether more data is covered than in
earlier proposals. This would make results comparable and would be a strong incentive not to fall
behind what was understood already. As an example I will use again the grammars of
the <a href="/Projects/CoreGram.html">CoreGram project</a>, which are backed up by
implementations, which ensures the consistency of the formalization and yields new insights and
discoveries which would not be possible without thorough formalization and implementation. The every
growing lists of covered phenomena ensures progress and helps with systematic testing. Although
computer implementations are very helpful in veryfying complex theories, this approach does not
require it and can be used for non-computational work as well.
