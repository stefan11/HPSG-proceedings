The facts are quite complex, but it is not too difficult to extend the SLASH mechanism of HPSG to handle dependencies with a null resumptive pronoun. It is also not too difficult to restrict the distribution of gaps appropriately.

Bonami, Olivier & Crysmann, Berthold # 0000-0003-0688-3855 & 0000-0003-0230-502X # Université Paris-Sorbonne § Institut universitaire de France § LLF (UMR 7110) & CNRS §  LLF  (UMR 7110) # Morphotactics in an information-based model of realisational morphology # 2013-10-17 # # 
In most recent work, Crysmann and Bonami (2012) suggest to reconcile the insights of
inferential-realisational morphology (Anderson, 1992; Stump, 2001; Brown and Hippisley, 2012) with
the full typology of variable morphotactics: situations where the expression of analogous feature
sets can appear in various positions in the string. The authors proposed to account for these facts
by importing, into HPSG, a variant of Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump, 2001) where realisation
rules are doubly indexed for linear position and paradigmatic opposition. In this paper we first
introduce more empirical challenges for theories of morphotactics that neither PFM nor the reformist
approach of Crysmann and Bonami (2012) can accommodate. We then argue for a reappraisal of methods
for morph introduction, and propose a new approach that replaces stipulation of classes of
paradigmatic opposition with a general distinction between expression and conditioning (Carstairs,
1987; Noyer, 1992) which greatly expands the scope of Pāṇini’s Principle.

Khoekhoe, a Central Khoisan language, has been claimed to have a clause-second position and
topological fields similar to German and Dutch. The position in front of the clause-second position
can be occupied by either the matrix verb or a dependent. We argue that monomoraic words are exempt
from the general head-final order of Khoekhoe and suggest that this can give rise to discontinuous
constituents, where second-position clitics intervene within the VP. We show that this idea provides
a simple account of Khoekhoe word order variation and formalize it within a linearization-based HPSG
analysis that has a wider scope than the previous Minimalist analyses of Khoekhoe and that is
compatible with evidence from tonology.

Nonverbal predicates in Modern Hebrew have been the subject of investigation in a number of
studies. However, to our knowledge, none of them was corpus-based. Corpus searches reveal that the
nonverbal constructions which are most commonly addressed in the literature are not the most
commonly used ones. Once a broader range of data is considered additional issues are raised. Our
analysis addresses these issues, unifying the treatment of three types of copular constructions that
we identify in MH. The analysis is implemented as part of a larger-scale grammar, and is extensively
tested.

Holler, Anke # mailed # University of Göttingen # Reanalyzing {German} correlative <em>es</em> # 2013-10-15 # # 
The present article discusses several aspects of the
so-called correlate-<em>es</em> construction in German. This complex clausal
construction can be identified by a correlative nominal element <em>es</em>
('it’) occuring in the matrix clause and a right-peripheral full clausal
argument linked to <em>es</em>. The article supports the hypothesis that
correlative <em>es</em> has a janus-faced nature between an expletive and a
referential meaning. This is the reason why existing approaches are not
sufficient to capture the properties of the discussed construction in its
entirety. The first part of the article sums up the common view on
correlative <em>es</em> including the empirical properties of the
construction as well as a brief survey of the relevant previous approaches
trying to account for correlative <em>es</em>. Based on new empirical data,
the second part of the article shows that none of these accounts is able
to capture all relevant facts of the correlate-<em>es</em> construction
because existing approaches usually ignore that the realization of
correlative <em>es</em> is verb-class dependent. Hence, a new
constraint-based analysis is developed that takes both empirical
observations into account, the verb-class dependence and the janus-faced
nature. 

Jin, Dawei # # University at Buffalo, SUNY # Information structure constraints and complex NP islands in {Chinese} # 2013-10-26 # #
This paper presents an analysis of the complex NP island effects in
Chinese. I follow Ginzburg & Sag (2000)'s analysis of <em>in situ
wh</em>-interrogative
construction and propose that feature percolation from the non-head clause
daughter to the head daughter is required for a proper treatment of <em>in
situ wh</em>-relative. A semantic analysis of the idiosyncrasy of
<em>weishenme</em> 'why' reveals that a definite reading is forced for a
<em>wh</em>-relative when <em>weishenme</em> stays <em>in situ</em>. This requirement causes
feature percolation into relative head to fail. In this way I show that
island effects in Chinese can be independently ruled out in the grammar as
a case of contradiction.

Maekawa, Takafumi # mailed # Ryukoku University # A beautiful four days in {Berlin} # 2013-10-15 # no # 
In this paper we look at one specific construction in English, where an
indefinite article and a plural noun can occur together (e.g., a beautiful
four days). Besides this number mismatch between the determiner and the
head noun, this construction is also peculiar in that the order of the
numeral and the adjective is the reverse of the canonical cases (e.g.,
four beautiful days). There are at least two analyses that might be
proposed within HPSG, a lexical analysis and a constructional analysis,
but we argue that the latter is the best analysis.

In this paper I introduce the notion of Usage Preferences (UPs), which are statistically significant
preferences in usage which can concern any aspect of linguistics. I suggest that multiple violations
of UPs can have additive effects, causing grammatical sentences to be judged as unacceptable. A new
judgment on sentences is proposed, the downarrow (↓) to mark sentences that are taken to be
grammatical but unacceptable due to UP violations. I illustrate the idea of UPs on the basis of a
discussion of the English verbal anaphor do so, involving both a corpus analysis and two
acceptability experiments. This leads to a discussion of the relationship between grammaticality and
acceptability and to remarks on the methodological importance of taking UPs into account both in
linguistic theorizing and in the construction of acceptability experiments.

We show how the variation in the passive in Danish, English, and German can be accounted for. The dimensions in which the three languages differ are 
<ul>
<li>the existence of a morphological passive in Danish
<li> a subject requirement in Danish and English resulting in expletive insertion in impersonal
  constructions in Danish and absence of impersonal passives in English 
<li> the possibility to promote the secondary object to subject in Danish
</ul>
The differences are accounted for by differences in the structural/lexical case distinction and by
mapping processes that insert expletives in Danish. The passive in general is accounted for by
a lexical rule that is uniform across languages and hence captures the generalization regarding passive.

This paper presents a syntactic HPSG analysis of distance distributivity in Polish, where the challenge is to uniformly analyse a number of function lexemes PO 'each' which share their form and semantic contribution, but differ in their syntactic behaviour. To this end, the HPSG notion of <em>weak head</em> is employed in a novel way.


Richter, Frank # 0000-0003-1929-5489 # Heinrich-Heine Universität Düsseldorf # 87, 94, 14? The Nature of Linguistic Theory
# October 16, 2013 # no # 
In the early days of HPSG, there was considerable emphasis on its
formal foundations and on the 'nature of linguistic theory' that would
go with a particular formalization. In fact, HPSG came with at least
two significantly different sets of foundational assumptions: A logic
of partial information in 1987, and a theory of linguistic types in
1994, soon to be followed by a number of modifications as the
mathematical details were spelled out and a few philosophical
disagreements over their interpretation were settled.
<p>
In the meantime, the way in which linguistic research is conducted has
changed: Controlled psycholinguistic experiments provide a much more
fine-grained picture of processing facts and the gradedness of human
acceptability judgments, statistical language modeling has become the
standard in computational linguistics, and large-scale corpora allow
insights into actual language use that were not available
before. Closer to home for HPSG, there is now a considerable number of
computational grammar implementations which show how HPSG fares
with respect to grammar fragments in different languages, and how these
grammars behave computationally.
<p>
In this talk, I would like to reconsider the nature of HPSG-style
grammar theory and its perspective on language in light of the
empirical turn in linguistics. Questions to be touched upon include
how suitable its foundational assumptions are for the description of
data gained with any of the empirical methods above, what these data
can or should tell us about linguistic theory, and which of them
should be considered subject to what kind of linguistic theory.
<p>
We know HPSG in 1987 and in 1994. My modest aim is to present
HPSG 2014.


Ryu, Byong-Rae # # Chungnam National University # Multiple case marking as case copying: A unified approach to multiple nominative and accusative constructions in {Korean} # 2013-10-18 ## 
This paper presents a unified approach to multiple nominative and accusative constructions in
Korean. We identify 16 semantic relations holding between two consecutive NPs in multiple case
marking constructions, and propose each semantic relation as a licensing condition on double case
marking.  We argue that the multiple case marking constructions are merely the sequences of double
case marking, which are formed by dextrosinistrally sequencing the pairs of the same-case marked NPs
of same or different type. Some appealing consequences of this proposal include a new comprehensive
classification of the sequences of same-case NPs and a straightforward account of some long standing
problems such as how the additional same-case NPs are licensed, and in what respects the multiple
nominative marking and the multiple accusative marking are alike and different from each other.


Szécsényi, Tibor # 0000-0002-7679-8317 # University of Szeged, Hungary # Argument inheritance and left periphery in {Hungarian} infinitival constructions # 2013-10-20 # #
Hungarian infinitival constructions have both mono-clausal
and bi-clausal properties at the same time. The arguments of the infinitive behave the same way as
the arguments of the finite verb do, but the non-finite verb has its own left periphery. After
discussing the general description of Hungarian sentence structure and presenting an HPSG analysis
for it &ndash; including a description of the connection between word order and scope order in the
Hungarian left periphery &ndash; this paper presents an analysis for Hungarian infinitival
constructions. The analysis lexically distinguishes the left peripheral arguments of the infinitive
from its complements, and allows the infinitive and its left peripheral arguments to form
constituents, while the complements of the infinitive are inherited to the finite verb.

In Dutch V-final clauses the verbs tend to form a cluster in which the main verb is separated from
its syntactic arguments by one or more other verbs.  In HPSG the link between the main verb and its
arguments is canonically modeled in terms of <i>argument inheritance</i>, also known as <i>argument
composition</i> or <i>generalized raising</i>.  When applied to Dutch, this treatment yields a
number of problems, making incorrect predictions about the interaction with the binding principles
and the passive lexical rule. To repair them this paper proposes an alternative, in which subject
raising and complement raising are modeled in terms of different devices. More specifically, while
subject raising is modeled in terms of lexical constraints, as for English, complement raising is
modeled in terms of a more general constraint on headed phrases. This new constraint not only
accounts for complement raising out of verbal complements, it also deals with complement raising out
of adjectival and adpositional complements, as well as with complement raising out of PP adjuncts
and subject NPs. It is, hence, a rather powerful device. To prevent overgeneration we add a number
of constraints. For Dutch, the relevant constraints block complement raising out of CPs, V-initial
VPs and P-initial PPs. For English, the Empty COMPS Constraint is sufficient to block complement
raising entirely.
