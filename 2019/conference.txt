A discourse-based approach # # no # The subject island constraint was defined as English specific in Pollard & Sag (1994), and abandoned in later versions (Sag, 2007, 2011). In this paper, we review new empirical data showing no cross-linguistic difference, but a difference between relative clauses, which permit extraction out of nominal subjects, and wh-questions, which show a subject penalty. We consider two possible HPSG accounts: one based on syntax, one based on information structure, and argue in favor of the latter.

In particular we shall reexamine the evidence in favour of argument composition and a flat VP structure with tense auxiliaries (Abeillé & Godard, 2002) and show (i) that the V (vs. VP) status of the complement does not strictly correlate with the possibility of clitic climbing, (ii) that transparency in bounded dependencies transcends the class of argument composition verbs, and (iii) that a flat VP structure complicates the treatment of modification and coordination. Adopting an approach in terms of periphrastic realisation along the lines of Bonami (2015), we can provide a treatment of the climbing facts that does full justice to the limited mobility and their morphologically bound status (Miller, 1992) without having to rely on a flat VP structure. Finally, we shall show that the pronominalisation and extraction facts can be dealt with in a uniform fashion by way of constraints on
canonical vs. non-canonical argument realisation. # Clitic climbing, French, HPSG, Periphrasis, VP structure, extraction, pronominalisation

An HPSG analysis of the full set of complexities is possible given a principle of blocking, whereby constraints with more specific antecedents take precedence over constraints with less specific antecedents, and a distinction between morphosyntactic features relevant to syntax and morphosyntactic features relevant to morphology. # copula, syntax-morphology mismatches, Welsh

In this paper I present an incremental approach to gapping in Japanese, where it is assumed that an argument structure type is constructed in the non-final clause(s) in the gapping construction. This type is unified with the construction type created by the final clause resulting in identical construction types for all conjuncts in the construction. # HPSG, Gapping, Japanese, Incremental Parsing

We argue that a lexical analysis of se provides us with a more accurate description of the different classes of psychological verbs that occur with the morpheme. We provide a unified analysis where the different uses of se are modeled by means of lexical rules. Our analysis shows the similarities and differences between the true-reflexive reading and the left-bounded reading achieved with se. Furthermore, we take the morphologically simple but semantically more complex basic items (e.g. asustar `frighten') as input of the lexical rules, giving us as the output a morphologically more complex but semantically simpler verb (e.g. asustarse `get frightened'). For psych-verbs, our analysis correctly allows only those verbs assigning accusative to the experiencer or the stimulus to combine with the se-morpheme, hence preventing dative verbs from entering the lexical rules. We also show how to account for punctual and non-punctual readings of psych-verbs with the se-morpheme incorporating `boundaries' into the type hierarchy of eventualities. # Spanish, Reflexives, Causative-Inchoative-Alternation, Psych-Verbs, Left Boundary

Building on corpus data, it identifies the types of verbs which can appear in the trivalent structure of [NP [V OBJ OBL]], where OBL is directional, and shows that this argument structure is not limited to cause-motion verbs. On the contrary, non-motion verbs which appear in the CDMC are interpreted as expressing caused-motion events by virtue of their appearance in the construction.

In these precdicate fronting constructions a verbal projection is fronted with the verb appearing in the remaining
clause as well. It is argued that this phenomenon follows the regular V2 syntax in Yiddish, that is,
it is not left dislocation or hanging topic. Because of this the phenomenon is handled via the SLASH
mechanism that is used for nonlocal dependencies in HPSG. Since material is doubled, we do not use
traces for the introduction of the nonlocal dependency but a lexical rule. It has been noted that
the fronted material may be more general than what stays behind. This is evidence against all
copy-based movement theories but it is compatible with an HPSG approach, in which the semantic
subsumption restrictions can be stated.

# # Progress toward distinguishing clearly between generative and model-theoretic syntactic frameworks has not been smooth or swift, and the obfuscatory term `constraint-based' has not helped. This paper reviews some elementary subregular formal language theory relevant to comparing description languages for model-theoretic grammars, generalizes the results to trees, and points out that HPSG linguists have maintained an unacknowledged and perhaps unintended allegiance to the idea of strictly local description: unbounded dependencies, in particular, are still being conceptualized in terms of plugging together local tree parts annotated with the SLASH feature. Adopting a description language with quantifiers holds out the prospect of eliminating the need for the SLASH feature.  We need to ask whether that would be a good idea. Binding domain phenomena might tell us. More work of both descriptive and mathematical sorts is needed before the answer is clear. # grammars, HPSG, constraints, model-theoretic syntax

We will provide a scalar extension of a standard semantic account of result clauses to capture the high degree interpretations. Our investigation will also offer new insights on NPI licensing in embedded clauses.  We will primarily consider Romanian data. # negative polarity item, result clause semantics, LRS, Romanian

Nominalized infinitives have the external distribution of an NP, but their internal structure is a mixture of verbal and nominal
characteristics. The purpose of this paper is (1) to provide a
description of the Dutch nominalized infinitive, (2) to model it in
terms of HPSG and (3) to compare the result with Rob Malouf’s mixed
category treatment of the English gerund.

Wechsler, Stephen # 0000-0003-4753-0212 # University of Texas at Austin # Distributed lexicalism # # no # In lexical approaches to argument structure, verb alternations (e.g.
<em>load the truck</em> ~ <em>load the hay</em>) have been analyzed by relating the
alternative complement patterns of a verb by means of lexical rules,
lexical mapping theories, type inheritance hierarchies, and argument
structure constructions.  But such theories lack a principled account
of the fact that the modulation in verb meaning is syntactically
localized, affecting some argument roles while leaving others
unchanged.  In contrast, certain constructional approaches, such as
those where semantic roles are assigned by null functional heads to
their specifiers (Marantz 1997, Harley 2012, i.a.), capture that
syntactic localization, but they are problematic for familiar reasons
related to lexicalism (Müller and Wechsler 2014) and the case against
neodavidsonian event semantics (Dowty 1989, Wechsler 2005).  This talk
resolves this dilemma with a revision of lexical theory called
<em>distributed lexicalism</em> with two new proposals.  First, a verb's
meaning is broken down and distributed across components of its
valence structure.  Second, thematic patterning of verbs, including
verb alternations, are explained not by grammar rules or intermediate
argument structures but by the fact that new verbs are assimilated to
the existing lexicon.  The resulting grammar goes beyond the
lexicalist assumption that verbs have valence structures, to a
''hyperlexicalist'' theory in which the patterning of those valence
structures follows from the emergent structure of the lexicon.
