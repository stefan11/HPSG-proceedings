<p>
In lexical approaches to argument structure, verb alternations (e.g.
<em>load the truck</em> ~ <em>load the hay</em>)  have been analyzed by relating the
alternative complement patterns of a verb by means of lexical rules,
lexical mapping theories, type inheritance hierarchies, and argument
structure constructions.  But such theories lack a principled account
of the fact that the modulation in verb meaning is syntactically
localized, affecting some argument roles while leaving others
unchanged.  In contrast, certain constructional approaches, such as
those where semantic roles are assigned by null functional heads to
their specifiers (Marantz 1997, Harley 2012, i.a.), capture that
syntactic localization, but they are problematic for familiar reasons
related to lexicalism (Müller and Wechsler 2014) and the case against
neodavidsonian event semantics (Dowty 1989, Wechsler 2005).  This talk
resolves this dilemma with a revision of lexical theory called
<em>distributed lexicalism</em> with two new proposals.  First, a verb's
meaning is broken down and distributed across components of its
valence structure.  Second, thematic patterning of verbs, including
verb alternations, are explained not by grammar rules or intermediate
argument structures but by the fact that new verbs are assimilated to
the existing lexicon.  The resulting grammar goes beyond the
lexicalist assumption that verbs have valence structures, to a
''hyperlexicalist'' theory in which the patterning of those valence
structures follows from the emergent structure of the lexicon.
