<p>
In this paper, we model the left-bounded state reading and the true reflexive reading of the se-morpheme in the Spanish psychological domain. We argue that a lexical analysis of se provides us with a more accurate description of the different classes of psychological verbs that occur with the morpheme. We provide a unified analysis where the different uses of se are modeled by means of lexical rules. Our analysis shows the similarities and differences between the true-reflexive reading and the left-bounded reading achieved with se. Furthermore, we take the morphologically simple but semantically more complex basic items (e.g. asustar `frighten') as input of the lexical rules, giving us as the output a morphologically more complex but semantically simpler verb (e.g. asustarse `get frightened'). For psych-verbs, our analysis correctly allows only those verbs assigning accusative to the experiencer or the stimulus to combine with the se-morpheme, hence preventing dative verbs from entering the lexical rules. We also show how to account for punctual and non-punctual readings of psych-verbs with the se-morpheme incorporating `boundaries' into the type hierarchy of eventualities.
