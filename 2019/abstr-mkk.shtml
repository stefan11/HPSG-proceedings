Approach
</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
We examine so-called Predicate Cleft constructions in Yiddish. In these precdicate
fronting constructions a verbal projection is fronted with the verb appearing in the remaining
clause as well. It is argued that this phenomenon follows the regular V2 syntax in Yiddish, that is,
it is not left dislocation or hanging topic. Because of this the phenomenon is handled via the SLASH
mechanism that is used for nonlocal dependencies in HPSG. Since material is doubled, we do not use
traces for the introduction of the nonlocal dependency but a lexical rule. It has been noted that
the fronted material may be more general than what stays behind. This is evidence against all
copy-based movement theories but it is compatible with an HPSG approach, in which the semantic
subsumption restrictions can be stated.
