</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
In this paper, we address resolution of gender and
person in French coordination and suggest that a list-based encoding of
feature values provides for a very simple and intuitive resolution mecha-
nism in coordinate structures by means of simple list concatenation, while
it leaves the treatment of agreement in head-compositional structures
entirely unaffected. We shall discuss the implementation of this approach
in the context of an emerging computational HPSG of French based on
the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002), and argue that the
problem at hand calls for concatenation by recursive copying (Emerson,
2017), as opposed to difference lists (Clocksin & Mellish, 1981). Finally,
we conclude that the list-based encoding of person and gender values can
act as a drop-in replacement for the standard sort-based encoding, since
it is not only more flexible in the treatment of feature resolution, but
also bears the further potential of representing more elaborate person
systems, like the inclusive/exclusive distinction.
