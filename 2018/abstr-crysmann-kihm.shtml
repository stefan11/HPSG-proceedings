<p>
In this paper, we study Old French declension, a system which exhibits
the theoretically challenging phenomenon of morphological reversal (Baerman,
2007). Furthermore, the declension system of Old French only recognises a
single exponent -s, which marks different case/number combinations in different
paradigms, contrasting with the unmarked form. We show that reversal is only
one of several syncretism patterns found in the language and propose that Old
French declension is best understood in terms of two systematic syncretisms: a
natural split between singular and plural for feminines, and a Paninian split for
masculines that systematically marks the objective plural. Reversal, and other
seemingly morphomic splits arise as a result of idiosyncrasy in the
NOM.SG cell, comprising inflection class-specific s-marking, as well as stem alternation and
overabundance. We provide a formal analysis in terms of Information-based
Morphology (Crysmann & Bonami, 2016) that effortlessly captures the systematic splits,
as well as the variation in the nominative singular. We suggest
that the high degree of idiosyncrasy in this cell paired with the reduced frequency of overt
nominative NPs when compared to objective NPs may serve
to explain why the system was actually quite short-lived.
