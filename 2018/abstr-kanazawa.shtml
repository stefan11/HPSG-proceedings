<p>
The four levels of the Chomsky hierarchy are not of equal importance and there is a huge gap between the context-free and the context-sensitive languages. Chomsky’s choice of semi-Thue systems as the most general form of grammar was inadequate for the investigation of many important language classes that lie in between the context-free and the context-sensitive, in particular the so-called “mildly context-sensitive languages”. The formalisms that capture these classes are not instances of Chomsky’s type 0 grammars. Smullyan’s elementary formal system, which is a kind of logic program on strings, provides the right level of generality and simplicity. Grammars should be thought of as “bottom-up” inductive definitions, rather than as “top-down” string rewriting systems.
