control: A view from Japanese
</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
It has been
controversial in the literature of control phenomena whether the
obligatory control status of the unexpressed subject in the so-called
'finite control' construction in Japanese is due to syntactic or
semantic factors (Fujii 2006, Gamerschlag 2007, Wang 2011, Akuzawa
2018, Akuzawa and Wang 2018). In this talk, I review evidence adduced
by Akuzawa and Wang (2018) for a semantics analysis of finite control
in Japanese and sketch a preliminary version of a semantics analysis
of control verbs in Japanese. Verbs that exhibit finite control in
Japanese range over what at first sight seem to be heterogeneous
classes, including aspectual, implicative, direcive and reflexive
verbs. I argue that the common semantic component of this apparently
non-uniform classes can be captured by extending the notion of
'responsibility', first identified by Farkas (1988) as an important
notion in understanding the lexical meanings of control predicates.
