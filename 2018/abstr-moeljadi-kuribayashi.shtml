<p>
The Jacy Japanese grammar (Siegel, Bender, & Bond, 2016; Siegel & Bender, 2002) is a broad coverage linguistically precise grammar of Japanese. It is based on the HPSG formalism with MRS semantics. In combination with a parser, it can analyze Japanese sentences, yielding derivation trees and MRS semantic representations, and also generate sentences from semantic representations. It has been used in various applications, such as in a spoken language machine translation project, where it was used in deep processing of appointment scheduling and travel reservation dialogues, in an industrial application of automatic email response, and in research on parse ranking with lexical semantics and machine translation. In this session, we will describe the fundamentals of Jacy: a short introduction, history, development environment, treebank, applications, the current state, and some interesting linguistic phenomena. We will show an online demo of Jacy parsing and generating sentences, the treebank, and some online documentation.
