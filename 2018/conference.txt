# Feature resolution in French coordination # 2018-10-16 # no #
In this paper, we address resolution of gender and
person in French coordination and suggest that a list-based encoding of
feature values provides for a very simple and intuitive resolution mecha-
nism in coordinate structures by means of simple list concatenation, while
it leaves the treatment of agreement in head-compositional structures
entirely unaffected. We shall discuss the implementation of this approach
in the context of an emerging computational HPSG of French based on
the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002), and argue that the
problem at hand calls for concatenation by recursive copying (Emerson,
2017), as opposed to difference lists (Clocksin & Mellish, 1981). Finally,
we conclude that the list-based encoding of person and gender values can
act as a drop-in replacement for the standard sort-based encoding, since
it is not only more flexible in the treatment of feature resolution, but
also bears the further potential of representing more elaborate person
systems, like the inclusive/exclusive distinction.<p>The paper is published in the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-57784-4">Proceedings of Formal Grammar 2018</a>. # Coordination, feature resolution, French, person hierarchy, grammar implementation, list

The syntactic representations assumed in <em>The Cambridge Grammar of the English
Language</em> (Huddleston, Rodney and Pullum, Geoffrey K (eds.). 2002, Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press) are not always conventional trees.  The analyses of Noun
Phrases in particular make extensive use of a limited form of multi-dominance, embodied in
the notion of a <em>fused-head</em> where a single constituent fullfils two grammatical
functions: the head function, and some other dependent function (e.g. determinative or
modifier). The approach has considerable intuitive appeal, especially when compared with
alternative analyses involving empty elements. In this paper, I attempt to formalise the
approach using the apparatus of HPSG and consider whether it would provide a useful
addition to the theoretical apparatus. The conclusions are largely negative: though the
basic idea can be formalised fairly simply, further investigation suggests raises some
serious formal difficulties. Moreover, a more detailed consideration of the relevant
phenomena suggests that in general construction based analyses of the kind that are widely
used in HPSG are preferable.

A characteristic aspect of such constructions is that the order of the verbs may differ from the order in which they are selected. Across the Dutch language area verb clusters show different types of word order variation. This paper proposes a constructivist account of word order variation in Dutch verb clusters. Linearization is not modelled in terms of the GVOR feature, after Kathol (2000). Instead, it relies on the bidimensional phrase hierarchy initiated by Ginzburg & Sag (2000), which is extended for the analysis of constructions with verb clusters. This proposal accounts for the most common instances of word order variation in Dutch verb clusters, and it can be easily adapted to model a specific variety or dialect. # Dutch, verb clusters, HPSG

In this paper, we study Old French declension, a system which exhibits
the theoretically challenging phenomenon of morphological reversal (Baerman,
2007). Furthermore, the declension system of Old French only recognises a
single exponent -s, which marks different case/number combinations in different
paradigms, contrasting with the unmarked form. We show that reversal is only
one of several syncretism patterns found in the language and propose that Old
French declension is best understood in terms of two systematic syncretisms: a
natural split between singular and plural for feminines, and a Paninian split for
masculines that systematically marks the objective plural. Reversal, and other
seemingly morphomic splits arise as a result of idiosyncrasy in the
NOM.SG cell, comprising inflection class-specific s-marking, as well as stem alternation and
overabundance. We provide a formal analysis in terms of Information-based
Morphology (Crysmann & Bonami, 2016) that effortlessly captures the systematic splits,
as well as the variation in the nominative singular. We suggest
that the high degree of idiosyncrasy in this cell paired with the reduced frequency of overt
nominative NPs when compared to objective NPs may serve
to explain why the system was actually quite short-lived. # Morphological reversal,

This analysis is based on decomposition of these operations into rule components, which in turn are expressed as lexical rule supertypes that implement specific, isolatable constraints. I also show how common variations of these constraints can be abstracted and parameterized by their axes of variation. I then demonstrate how these constraints can be recomposed in various combinations to provide broad coverage of the typological variation of valence change found in the world’s languages. I evaluate the coverage of this library on five held-out world languages that exhibit
these phenomena, achieving 79% coverage and 2% overgeneration. # HPSG, Valence Change, Grammar Matrix

Based on Meir's Agreement Morphology Principles it presents an HPSG analysis of plain, regular and backwards agreement verbs that models the interaction between phonological (manual) features and syntactico-semantic relationships within a verbal sign by well-defined lexical restrictions. We argue that a sign-based declarative analysis can provide an elegant approach to agreement in sign language since it allows to exploit cross-modular constraints within grammar, and hence permits a direct manipulation of all relevant phonological features of a verb depending on its syntactic and semantic properties.#HPSG, DGS, Agreement, PAM

To account for the range of variation in nominalized clauses across the world's languages and to support linguists in exploring alternative analyses, we propose a flexible library of analyses, allowing nominalization of the clause to occur at the V, VP or S level. # HPSG, Typology, Grammar Engineering, Nominalized clauses, Nominalization, Grammar Matrix

Kanazawa, Makoto # 0000-0003-3845-4748 # Hosei University, Japan # What was wrong with the Chomsky hierarchy? # # no # The four levels of the Chomsky hierarchy are not of equal importance and there is a huge gap between the context-free and the context-sensitive languages. Chomsky’s choice of semi-Thue systems as the most general form of grammar was inadequate for the investigation of many important language classes that lie in between the context-free and the context-sensitive, in particular the so-called “mildly context-sensitive languages”. The formalisms that capture these classes are not instances of Chomsky’s type 0 grammars. Smullyan’s elementary formal system, which is a kind of logic program on strings, provides the right level of generality and simplicity. Grammars should be thought of as “bottom-up” inductive definitions, rather than as “top-down” string rewriting systems.

semantics # 2018-10-15 # # The paper shows how the plural semantic
ideas of (Sternefeld, 1998) can be captured in Lexical Resource
Semantics, a system of underspecied semantics. It is argued that
Sternefeld's original approach, which allows for the unrestricted
insertion of pluralisation into Logical Form, suffers from a problem
originally pointed out by Lasersohn (1989) with respect to the analysis
offered by Gillon (1987). The problem is shown to stem from repeated
pluralisation of the same verbal argument and to be amenable to a
simple solution in the proposed lexical analysis, which allows for
restricting the pluralisations that can be inserted. The paper further
develops an account of maximalisation of pluralities as needed to
obtain the correct readings for sentences with quantiers that are not
upward monotone. Such an account is absent in the orginal system in
(Sternefeld, 1998). The present account makes crucial use of the
possibility to have distinct constituents contribute identical semantic
material offered by LRS and employs it in an analysis of maximalisation
in terms of polyadic quantication.# plural, lexical resource semantics,

Nevertheless, one non-canonical variant has been largely neglected. In this variant the copula, flanked by two NPs, exhibits agreement with the post-copular NP, contrary to the canonical variant, where the agreement controller is the initial NP. This phenomenon challenges the notion of subject and its relation to agreement. The current corpus-based study investigates the word order and agreement patterns exhibited by the Hebrew copular constructions and shows that their distribution is largely motivated by information structure considerations. The proposed analysis accounts for the syntactic symmetry and semantic asymmetry between the two NPs. # HPSG, copula, agreement, inversion, Information Structure, Hebrew

ambiguities and lexical resource semantics: The case of gapping #

create semantic ambiguities (Siegel, 1984). For example, in <em>John can’t
live in L.A. and Mary in New York</em>, the negated modal can be part of
each conjunct’s interpretation, or it can outscope the entire
coordination. In this talk, we show how Lexical Resource Semantics
(Richter and Sailer, 2004) (LRS) can model these ambiguities
semantically, without the need to assume syntactic ambiguity (Kubota and
Levine, 2016; Potter et al., 2017). We provide an analysis in which
scope ambiguity in gapping results from independently motivated semantic
types for clauses (Champollion, 2015) and the underspecification of what
is being conjoined. Our paper thus provides a new solution to a
long-standing puzzle (why the interaction between gapping and scopal
operators allows for readings unavailable to ungapped sentences) and
serves as a case study in the benefits of HPSG and LRS in modeling the
interaction between ellipsis and scope. # HPSG, gapping, Lexical
