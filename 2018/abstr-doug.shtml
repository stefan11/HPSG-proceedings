<p>
The syntactic representations assumed in <em>The Cambridge Grammar of the English
Language</em> (Huddleston, Rodney and Pullum, Geoffrey K (eds.). 2002, Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press) are not always conventional trees.  The analyses of Noun
Phrases in particular make extensive use of a limited form of multi-dominance, embodied in
the notion of a <em>fused-head</em> where a single constituent fullfils two grammatical
functions: the head function, and some other dependent function (e.g. determinative or
modifier). The approach has considerable intuitive appeal, especially when compared with
alternative analyses involving empty elements. In this paper, I attempt to formalise the
approach using the apparatus of HPSG and consider whether it would provide a useful
addition to the theoretical apparatus. The conclusions are largely negative: though the
basic idea can be formalised fairly simply, further investigation suggests raises some
serious formal difficulties. Moreover, a more detailed consideration of the relevant
phenomena suggests that in general construction based analyses of the kind that are widely
used in HPSG are preferable.
