<p>
The 22th International Conference on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (2015) was held at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
<p>

<p>
A workshop on <em>Verb Classes and the Scale of Change in Affected Arguments</em>
was attached to the conference. The workshop had six invited speakers and 
five regular papers. The workshop program was put together by František Kratochvíl and Joanna Ut-Seong Sio.
<p>
<p>
<p>
We want to thank the respective program committees for putting this nice program together.
<p>
Thanks go to Francis Bond, who was
in charge of local arrangements, and his assistants Sanghoun Song, Michael Goodman,  Luis Morgado da Costa.
<p>
<p>
As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.
<p>
The proceedings include all the papers except the one by Sanghoun Song, Chen Bo, Joanna Sio Ut
Seong, and Francis Bond titled <em>An HPSG-based Analysis of Resultative Compounds in Chinese</em>,
the one by Frank van Eynde, which is published in his book on predication, and the ones by I Wayan
Arka, Kazuko Yatsuhiro, Juwon Lee, and Hans
Uszkoreit. Most of the workshop contributions will be published in a separate volume and therefore
are also not included.
<p>
<p>

<p>

The <a href="toc.shtml">table of contents</a> lists all the
papers presented at the conference. Some papers were not submitted to
the proceedings. For these papers, we suggest contacting the authors
directly.
