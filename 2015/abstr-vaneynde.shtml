</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
The talk presents and compares two ways of analyzing clauses with a 
predicative complement. One treats the predicate selecting verbs, 
such as <em>be</em> and <em>become</em>, as subject raisers and assumes that their 
predicative complements are unsaturated phrases that denote a state-of-affairs.  
The other treats the predicate selecting verbs as two-place relations 
between the referents of their predicative complement and the subject. 
Building on observations about binding and agreement in clauses with a
predicative complement it is shown that the second treatment is more in
line with independently motivated theories of binding and agreement 
than the first treatment. The talk is based on part II of 
Frank Van Eynde (2015), Predicative Constructions, CSLI Publications.
