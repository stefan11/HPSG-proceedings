Aguila-Multner, Gabriel & Crysmann, Berthold # # Université de Paris, Laboratoire de linguistique formelle, CNRS # An inside-out approach to
French causatives # 2020-10-15# # In this paper, we provide a
novel account of French causatives that crucially derives the core
properties of the construction inside-out from the downstairs lexical
verb to the causative verb, rather than outside-in, as is commonly
assumed by argument composition (Miller & Sag, 1997; Abeillé & Godard,
1997; Abeillé et al., 1998).  We shall argue on the basis of clitic
trapping (Miller & Sag, 1997), as well as marking of the downstairs
subject (Koenig, 1998) that the downstairs verb assumes a more active
role than what is suggested by an argument composition approach and,
conversely, we shall show that argument composition leads to problems
with coordination and with en-cliticisation. The analysis we are going
to propose combines an inversion analysis of the downstairs subject as
a downstairs complement, accounting for scrambling and case marking,
with an analysis of clitic climbing in terms of inflectional
periphrasis (Aguila-Multner & Crysmann 2020). # Clitic climbing,

Smurf-based Approach to Placeholder Expressions # 2020-10-15 # # The Smurf comics series is, among others, famous for the so-called "smurf language", in which words or parts of words can be replaced by "smurf". We will argue that this "smurfing" has the properties of placeholding. Based on data from German translations of Smurf comics, we will provide a formalization of smurfing in German which can be generalized to a theory of placeholder expressions. # German, HPSG, morphology, placeholder expression, smurfing

The current study presents an HPSG analysis for verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese. After discussing its interaction with Aktionsarten and aspect markers, we argue that it is a morphological rather than syntactic process. We put forward a lexical rule for verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese and the different forms of reduplication are captured in an inheritance hierarchy. The interaction between verbal reduplication and aspect marking is handled by multiple inheritance. This analysis covers all forms of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese and has none of the shortcomings of the previous analyses.
