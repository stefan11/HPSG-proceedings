constructions in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). MSA has several
embedded clause constructions, some of which resemble control in
English (and other languages). However, these constructions exhibit
some notable differences. Chief among them is the fact that the
embedded verb carries agreement features that can indicate both
coreference and disjoint reference between a matrix argument and the
understood subject of the complement clause. We conducted a thorough
corpus-based investigation of such constructions, with a special focus
on a search for obligatory control in the language. We show that our
findings contradict accepted generalizations (and predictions)
proposed by state-of-the-art theories of control, as they indicate
that there are no "real" control predicates in MSA. We outline an HPSG
analysis that accounts for the MSA data. # control, coreference,

Externally and internally headed relative clauses in {Marori} #
2016-12-16 ## This paper discusses relative clauses (RCs) in Marori,
showing that this language unusually has almost all of relative clause
types, from headed/headless, externally/internally headed,
single-/double-headed, to pre-/post-head, to attached/detached
RCs. Special attention is given to internally headed relative clauses
(IHRC). It is argued that Marori IHRCs are of the restrictive or
non-maximalising type, which accounts for certain intriguing
properties, such as their indefiniteness constraints and the
possibility for RC stacking. # relative clauses, information

level: gender and person agreement. In the general case, person
agreement is hierarchical (speech act participants prefered to 3rd
persons), while gender agreement is with the absolutive (S/P)
argument. Two exceptions to this pattern have been observed in some
dialects: first, some auxiliary verbs have a gender agreement slot
which can be controlled by both ergative and absolutive arguments;
second, adverbials agreeing in gender can agree with either ergative
or absolutive if they are located at clause edges. A proposed
explanation of this behaviour is through effectively splitting each
clause into two layers, with the top layer having its own zero
absolutive position, coreferential with either the subject or the
direct object of the lower layer. In this way, the general rule that
gender agreement is with the absolutive can be preserved. In this
paper, I argue that the data of Ashti Dargwa do not support the
Backward Control theory. Peripheral adverb agreement and auxiliary
gender agreement are independent phenomena, while auxiliary agreement
can be explained by splitting the 3rd person based on topicality, as
in proximateobviative systems. This allows us to preserve the
conventional account of clause structure while framing the data of
Dargwa in a wider typological context.

## Languages differ in how they employ finite and non-finite
clauses. Welsh finite and non-finite clauses have a similar
distribution to their counterparts in English. However, it doesn’t
look like this because Welsh has certain finite clauses which look
rather like non-finite clauses.  We examine two types of
pseudo-non-finite clauses: finite "bod" clauses and finite "i"
clauses. We argue that both cases are instances of a mismatch between
syntax and morphology, while the latter only involves periphrasis. We
provide an HPSG analysis capturing similarities and differences
between these two constructions and canonical finite and nonfinite
clauses. # Welsh, finiteness, syntax-morphology relation, periphrasis.

Preliminary results from the {Free Linguistic Environment} project # 2016-12-16 # # The Free Linguistic Environment (FLE) project focuses on the
development of an open and free library of natural language processing
functions and a grammar engineering platform for Lexical Functional
Grammar (LFG) and related grammar frameworks. In its present state the
code-base of FLE contains basic essential elements for LFG-parsing. It
uses finite-state-based morphological analyzers and syntactic
unification parsers to generate parse-trees and related functional
representations for input sentences based on a grammar.  It can
process a variety of grammar formalisms, which can be used
independently or serve as backbones for the LFG parser. Among the
supported formalisms are Context-free Grammars (CFG), Probabilistic
Contextfree Grammars (PCFG), and all formal grammar components of the
XLEgrammar formalism. The current implementation of the LFG-parser
includes the possibility to use a PCFG backbone to model probabilistic
c-structures.  It also includes f-structure representations that allow
for the specification or calculation of probabilities for complete
f-structure representations, as well as for sub-paths in f-structure
trees. Given these design features, FLE enables various forms of
probabilistic modeling of c-structures and f-structures for input or
output sentences that go beyond the capabilities of other technologies
based on the LFG framework.

In the case of idiomatic particle verb constructions, a mechanism specific to
XLFG was used. This allowed us to propose a preferential choice of the idiomatic

This way of prioritizing an idiomatic construction, if it exists, and fall back
on a compositional construction by default, seems to be coherent with both the

An underspecification approach to {Hausa} resumption #
2016-12-16 # # Within recent work on the treatment of resumption
in HPSG, there is growing consensus that resumptive unbounded
dependency constructions (=UDCs) should be modelled on a par with
gap-type UDCs (Alotaibi and Borsley, 2013; Borsley, 2010; Crysmann,
2012b; Taghvaipour, 2005), using a single feature for both types of
dependencies, rather than separate features, as proposed by Vaillette
(2001a,b). Yet, authors disagree as to where exactly in the grammar
the resumptive function of pronominals should be established: while
Crysmann (2012b, 2015) advances an ambiguity approach that has
pronominal synsem objects being ambiguous between a resumptive and an
ordinary pronoun use, Borsley (2010); Alotaibi and Borsley (2013), by
contrast, treat all pronominals, resumptive or not, as ordinary
pronouns and effect their resumptive use by means of tailoring the
amalgamation principle to potentially include pronominal
indices. While their decision provides a straightforward account of
McCloskey’s generalisation that resumptives always look like the
ordinary pronouns of the language, it fails to capture the difference
in semantics between ordinary pronominal and resumptive uses.  In this
paper, I shall reexamine the evidence from Hausa and propose to
synthesise the approaches put forth by Alotaibi and Borsley (2013) and
Crysmann (2012b), and propose that the potential for pronominal and
resumptive function (including their difference w.r.t. semantics and
non-local features) is captured by means of underspecification, yet
the decision as to canonical vs.  non-canonical use is made at the
level of the governing head (Borsley, 2010; Alotaibi and Borsley,
2013). I shall argue that this division of labour is sufficient to
derive the correct gap-like semantics for resumptives, maintains
standard deterministic amalgamation, and, finally, provides an answer
to McCloskey’s generalisation. # Hausa, resumption, underspecification, islands

that the perfect always consists of a one-place intransitive but that
it, nonetheless, retains the capacity to express two argument

certain flaws in the semantics for lexical rule specifications
developed in Meurers (2001). Under certain circumstances, certain
words may not be licit inputs to a rule according to this semantics
while one would expect them to be from inspecting the specification of
the rule. The reasons for this are shown to be that whether properties
of paths should be transferred from the input of a rule to its output
is decided considering only the respective paths and their properties
in isolation, ignoring the ‘non-local’ effects that transferring their
properties can have. Furthermore, the semantics is insensitive to the
possible shapes of inputs to the rule, which also makes it possible
that inputs of certain shapes are unexpectedly not accepted. An
alternative semantics is developed that does not suffer from these
deficits.

Ramhöj, Rickard # mailed # University of Gothenburg # On the argument structure of raising-to-subject with passive predicates in {Swedish} # 2016-12-16 # # This paper concerns the argument structure analysis of
raising-to-subject with passive predicates in Swedish and other
Germanic languages. Support is given for the analysis in which the
raising-to-subject construction constitutes a regular passive, the
passive counterpart of active raising-to-object. The fact that there
does not seem to be an active counterpart for certain predicates, such
as the predicate say, as well as the fact that raising-to-subject does
not seem to be possible with the periphrastic passive in Swedish is
attributed to certain semantic restrictions on the raising-to-object
construction and the periphrastic passive construction, respectively.

2016-12-16 # # Early work on quantification in natural languages showed that
sentences like `Every ape picked different berries', on the reading
that the sets of berries picked by any two apes are not the same, can
be logically represented with a single polyadic quantifier for the
two nominal phrases. However, since that quantifier cannot be
decomposed into two quantifiers for the two nominal phrases, a
compositional semantic analysis of this reading is not possible
under standard assumptions about syntax and semantics. This paper
shows how a constraint-based semantics with Lexical Resource
Semantics can define a systematic syntax-semantics interface which
captures the reading in question with a polyadic quantifier. # constraint-based

Ritchie, Sandy # mailed # SOAS # Two cases of prominent internal possessor constructions # 2016-12-16 # # This paper outlines a new analysis of
the syntactic structure and discourse function of a ‘prominent
internal possessor construction’ (PIPC) in Chimane (unclassified,
Bolivia) and compares it with an existing analysis of a different kind
of PIPC found in Maithili (Indo- Aryan, India/Nepal). PIPCs in Chimane
and Maithili involve an apparently non-local agreement relation
between verbs and possessors which are internal to possessive NPs. In
Chimane, it is argued that internal possessors are able to control
object agreement via a clause-level ‘proxy’ of the internal possessor
– see also Ritchie (under review). The paper goes on to compare this
construction with PIPCs in Maithili, and shows that speakers use PIPCs
in discourse to indicate the information structure role of the
internal possessor. In the case of Chimane, it seems that internal
possessors which bear the secondary topic role are more likely to
control object agreement, while in Maithili, other semantic and
information structural features of internal possessors are at
play. The contributions of the various levels of sentence structure
are modelled using the LFG architecture developed in Dalrymple &
Nikolaeva (2005; 2011).

nouns, as well as anaphoric definites. We argue for a
three-dimensional analysis of definiteness: an individual denotation,
an existence presupposition, and a uniqueness conventional
implicature. We present an HPSG encoding of this system and model the
central aspects of the definite marking systems of our three object

# # Right-node raising is usually set apart from other elliptical
constructions for imposing a strict identity condition between the
omitted and the peripheral elements. Since Pullum & Zwicky (1986), it
is assumed that only syncretic forms may resolve a feature conflict
between the two conjuncts (<i>I certainly will and you already have set
the record straight. </i>). We present an empirical study of RNR with
final verb in English and French that shows that verb mismatch does
occur in corpora with and without syncretic forms, i.e. that
syncretism does not appear to play a role. We present an acceptability
judgement task on French that confirms this hypothesis. We therefore
propose a new HPSG analysis of RNR that is based on sharing LID
features and not morphophonological forms.

Van Eynde, Frank # 0000-0002-6172-442X # University of Leuven # How regular a pattern in these labyrinths of constructions! # # no # The paper discusses two types of noun phrases with 
idiosyncratic properties: the Big Mess Construction and the 
Binominal Noun Phrase Construction.
Employing the framework of constructivist Head-driven Phrase 
Structure Grammar I develop an analysis of these constructions 
with equal attention for their regular and irregular properties. 
For this purpose I make use of a bidimensional hierarchy of phrase 
types, in which the higher (less specific) types capture the regularities, 
in which the maximally specific types capture the idiosyncracies, 
and in which the intermediate types cover the zone in between. 
The resulting treatment is compared with a number of alternative 
treatments, both transformational and monostratal ones. 
The more general purpose of the paper is to show how the treatment 
of idiosyncratic constructions can be integrated in a framework that 
allows for a continuum between the regular and the idiosyncratic, 
rather than for a dichotomy between them.
