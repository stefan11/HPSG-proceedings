Korean has two types of answers shorter than full sentential answers: Fragments and null argument
constructions. Apparently the two constructions have the same interpretative processes. However,
there are some cases where the fragment and null argument construction behave differently: e.g.,
wh-puzzles, sloppy interpretation. We suggest that the two constructions involve two different types
of anaphora and that the sources of sloppy(-like) interpretation are fundamentally
distinct. Fragments pattern differently with null arguments in that only the former may display
genuine sloppy readings. The latter may yield sloppy-like readings which are pragmatically induced
by the explicature that can be cancelled unlike genuine sloppy readings in fragments. Evidence
(wh-ellipsis, quantifier ellipsis) all lends substantial support to our claim that fragments are
analyzed as an instance of clausal ellipsis while null arguments are analyzed as an instance of null
pronoun pro; hence, the former is surface anaphora whereas the latter is deep anaphora in the sense
of Hankamer & Sag (1976).  

Erschler, David # 0000-0001-6977-896X # Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tübingen and University of
Tübingen # Sluicing-like phenomena and the location of CP in Ossetic # # no # In this talk, I show
that Digor and Iron Ossetic, closely related Iranian languages spoken in the Central Caucasus, show
sluicing in the proper sense and argue on this basis for the low (preverbal) position of
complementizers in the Ossetic clause structure. The classical sluicing occurs in wh-fronting
languages, and it is only the wh-phrase(s) that is retained:
<p>
(1)	Anne invited someone, but I don’t know who. (Merchant 2001: 40)
<p>
	Sluicing-like constructions, however, are also attested in languages that either lack
        wh-movement or show non-canonical patterns thereof. The issue how to analyze such structures
        is controversial, see, e.g. the polemics between Ince (2012) and Hankamer (2011) on the
        proper analysis of Turkish sentences of this type. 
<p>
	In Ossetic, wh-phrases and certain complementizers are obligatorily preverbal, no matter
        where the verb is situated in the clause, and only certain items may intervene between the
        wh-phrases/complementizer and the verb, Erschler (2012). It is an obvious challenge to
        theories of “left periphery” to analyze such a structure: even if the preverbal placement of
        wh-phrases might be explained away as focusing, it can be hardly done so for
        complementizers. Despite the unusual patterns of wh-placement and complementation, Ossetic
        shows a construction that is at least superficially similar to sluicing. I show that,
        analogously to the “classical” sluicing, this type of ellipsis can go backwards, is
        unbounded, and is not sensitive to islands.
<p>
	That Ossetic (pseudo)-sluicing is indeed an independent type of ellipsis, and not a
        subvariety of stripping [as argued for Turkish pseudo-sluicing in Hankammer (2011)], follows
        from the fact that, unlike sluicing, Ossetic stripping is ungrammatical in dependent clauses
        and cannot go backwards.
<p>
	Another potential analysis of pseudo-sluicing, reduced cleft, is ruled out because the
        copula cannot be inserted in sluices, cf a similar argument in Toosarvandani (2008: 682-684)
        for Persian. Thus it is natural to analyze Ossetic (pseudo)-sluicing as the classical
        sluicing, i.e. as deletion of the material below C. If my proposal is on the right track, it
        provides additional evidence that Ossetic indeed has C in the preverbal position.

# Tense and honorific interpretations in Korean gapping construction:<br> A constraint- and construction-based approach # 2012-10-20 # # 
Chung (2001) claims that non-final conjuncts without overt tense morphemes which produce asymmetric
tense interpretations are to be analyzed as TP; and Lee (2005) argues that the verbal honorific
affix -si- never occurs in non-final conjuncts so honorific agreement between the subject and the
verb takes place in the final conjunct only and thus the Korean gapping constructions should be
analyzed as vP coordination. However, these two previous analyses seem to fail to make the
generalizations on the distributional behaviors of gapping constructions, facing theoretical and
empirical difficulties. To solve the problems they face, we claim that verbal gapping in Korean is
allowed to occur in all non-final conjuncts when the covert predicates of the non-final conjuncts
have an identical semantic relation value with that of the overt verb in the final conjunct,
regardless of the consistency of the honorific and tense values between conjuncts.

In this paper I use the formal framework of minimalist grammars to implement a version of the
traditional approach to ellipsis as ‘deletion under syntactic (derivational) identity’, which, in
conjunction with canonical analyses of voice phenomena, immediately allows for voice mismatches in
verb phrase ellipsis, but not in sluicing. This approach to ellipsis is naturally implemented in a
parser by means of threading a state encoding a set of possible antecedent derivation contexts
through the derivation tree. Similarities between ellipsis and pronominal resolution are easily
stated in these terms. In the context of this implementation, two approaches to ellipsis in the
transformational community are naturally seen as equivalent descriptions at different levels: the
LF-copying approach to ellipsis resolution is best seen as a description of the parser, whereas the
phonological deletion approach a description of the underlying relation between form and meaning.

The dispreference for subject case ellipsis in OSV sentences has been analyzed as resulting from a
violation of a structural requirement on the position of bare subject NPs (Ahn and Cho 2006a, 2006b,
2007). In this study, we present evidence from an acceptability rating experiment demonstrating that
OSV sentences containing a case-ellipsed subject exhibit acceptability patterns different from
ungrammatical sentences violating a core syntactic principle on case assignment and that these
sentences are judged acceptable when the subject refers to expected, predictable information in
context. This evidence supports the conclusion that the dispreference for subject case ellipsis in
OSV sentences is due to violations of probabilistic constraints that favor case marking for rare
types of subjects and such violations can be remedied by non-syntactic information.

This paper presents an HPSG formalisation of how the ellipsis of case-marking affects the focus of
the clause in Japanese. We restrict our attention to the nominative and accusative markers ga and o,
and in view of the fact that the ellipsis effects on focushood vary between 1) ga and o and 2)
different argument structures of the head verb, develop an essentially lexicalist account that
combines both aspects, in which the implicit focus argument position is specified in the
predicate. We argue that if a constituent is an implicit focus it does not, while if one is not it
does, require a case-marker to be focused.

The paper begins by drawing a distinction among the topics addressed
by the theme of the session between grammatical (RNR, gapping etc.)
and anaphoric (VP anaphora, sluicing etc.) varieties of ellipsis,
recalling Hankamer and Sag 1976.  Among grammatical ellipses, there is
a conspiracy between unbounded constructions like relativization,
intonational phrasing, and ellipses like gapping, all of which seem to
apply to or give rise to non-constituent fragments, contrary to the
constituent condition on rules. A number of theories including GPSG
and HPSG have reacted to this problem by restoring constituent status
to some or all such fragments under some generalized notion of
constituency.
<p>
The paper looks at the specific problem of intonation structure in
English, and shows, following Steedman 2000a,b, that the system of
combinatory rules available in CCG can explain intonation structure in
terms of exactly the same syntactic mechanism used for other varieties
of ellipsis including coordination and relativization.  The paper
offers a novel information-structural semantics for intonation
structure couched in a version of Mats Rooth's Alternative Semantics,
and addresses certain shortcomings in earlier versions of both
theories.
<p>
The paper concludes by addressing the question of how a similar
analysis could be imported into HPSG. Following Klein's 2000 paper to
this conference, it concludes that this is entirely possible, but
notes some redundancy with the existing slash feature treatment of
long-range dependency, suggesting that we need to look deeper for
commonalities across these two formalisms.

Yatabe, Shûichi # 0000-0003-2092-6073 # University of Tokyo # Comparison of the ellipsis-based theory of non-constituent coordination with its alternatives # 2012-10-15 # #
In this paper, I compare the ellipsis-based theory of non-constituent coordination proposed in
Yatabe (2001) with three of its alternatives, namely the theory that has been widely accepted within
the context of Categorial Grammar, Mouret's HPSG-based theory, and the theory proposed by Bachrach
and Katzir in the framework of the Minimalist Program.  It is found (i) that the CG-based theory of
non-constituent coordination cannot deal with medial RNR, i.e. a subset of right-node raising
constructions in which either all or a part of the right-node-raised material is realized at a
location other than the right edge of the final conjunct, (ii) that Mouret's theory encounters
similar difficulties when applied to RNR, and (iii) that Bachrach and Katzir's theory cannot be
applied to left-node raising in English, has difficulty capturing the semantic inertness of medial
RNR, and overgenerates in several ways.  The ellipsis-based theory, on the other hand, appears to be
consistent with all the observations.
