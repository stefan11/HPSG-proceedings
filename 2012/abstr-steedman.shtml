The paper begins by drawing a distinction among the topics addressed
by the theme of the session between grammatical (RNR, gapping etc.)
and anaphoric (VP anaphora, sluicing etc.) varieties of ellipsis,
recalling Hankamer and Sag 1976.  Among grammatical ellipses, there is
a conspiracy between unbounded constructions like relativization,
intonational phrasing, and ellipses like gapping, all of which seem to
apply to or give rise to non-constituent fragments, contrary to the
constituent condition on rules. A number of theories including GPSG
and HPSG have reacted to this problem by restoring constituent status
to some or all such fragments under some generalized notion of
constituency.
<p>
The paper looks at the specific problem of intonation structure in
English, and shows, following Steedman 2000a,b, that the system of
combinatory rules available in CCG can explain intonation structure in
terms of exactly the same syntactic mechanism used for other varieties
of ellipsis including coordination and relativization.  The paper
offers a novel information-structural semantics for intonation
structure couched in a version of Mats Rooth's Alternative Semantics,
and addresses certain shortcomings in earlier versions of both
theories.
<p>
The paper concludes by addressing the question of how a similar
analysis could be imported into HPSG. Following Klein's 2000 paper to
this conference, it concludes that this is entirely possible, but
notes some redundancy with the existing slash feature treatment of
long-range dependency, suggesting that we need to look deeper for
commonalities across these two formalisms.
