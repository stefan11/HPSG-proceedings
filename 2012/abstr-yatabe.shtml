</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
In this paper, I compare the ellipsis-based theory of non-constituent coordination proposed in
Yatabe (2001) with three of its alternatives, namely the theory that has been widely accepted within
the context of Categorial Grammar, Mouret's HPSG-based theory, and the theory proposed by Bachrach
and Katzir in the framework of the Minimalist Program.  It is found (i) that the CG-based theory of
non-constituent coordination cannot deal with medial RNR, i.e. a subset of right-node raising
constructions in which either all or a part of the right-node-raised material is realized at a
location other than the right edge of the final conjunct, (ii) that Mouret's theory encounters
similar difficulties when applied to RNR, and (iii) that Bachrach and Katzir's theory cannot be
applied to left-node raising in English, has difficulty capturing the semantic inertness of medial
RNR, and overgenerates in several ways.  The ellipsis-based theory, on the other hand, appears to be
consistent with all the observations.
