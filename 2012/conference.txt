This paper describes free relative constructions in Modern Standard Arabic (henceforth, MSA) and
aims to provide an HPSG analysis for them. MSA has two types of free relative constructions. One,
which is introduced by the complementizer ʔallaði, looks just like a relative clause. The other,
which is introduced by the elements man and maa, which also appear to be complementizers, does not
look like a relative clause. Both types can be analysed in term of unary-branching structures (as
NPs consisting just of a CP). In ʔallaði free relatives, the NP and the value of SLASH can be
coindexed via the value of MOD on the CP. In man and maa free relatives, the NP and the value of
SLASH must be coindexed directly.

In HPSG relative clauses have been analyzed in terms of phonologically empty heads in Pollard and
Sag (1994) and in terms of a complex system of phrase types in Sag (1997). Modern Standard Arabic
has a distinction between relative clauses with a definite antecedent, which are introduced by a
special complementizer, and relative clauses with an indefinite antecedent, which are ‘bare’
clauses. Analyses eschewing empty heads and assuming a complex system of phrase types face a number
of problems. An analysis in which relatives with an indefinite antecedent are headed by a
phonologically empty complementizer is more satisfactory. Thus, in the case of Arabic, the approach
of Pollard and Sag (1994) seems preferable to the approach of Sag (1997). 


Bjerre, Anne # 0000-0003-1622-5266 # University of Southern Denmark # An analysis of Danish free relatives # 2012-10-12 # #
This paper presents an analysis of Danish free relative constructions. Fol- lowing Bresnan and
Grimshaw (1978) we will adopt a wh-head (in Danish hv-head) analysis where the hv-phrase is the head
of an NP. Also following Bresnan and Grimshaw (1978) we will propose an analysis which does not
involve a filler-gap dependency between the hv-phrase and the gap in the sis- ter clause. Instead we
will propose that the gap in the sister clause is bound off by a constructional constraint. In this
way the analysis will be shown to differ from previous HPSG wh-head analyses of free relatives.

There are various
Verbal Suffix-Repetition (VSR) constructions in Korean, where suffixes such as <em>-kena/tun(ci)/tun(ka)</em> are attached to the repeated verbs. Calling the VSR Choice-denying Repeated Verbs
construction, Lee (2011) claims that the following verb of the VSR, which can be replaced with mal-,
should contain a negative but the preceding verb should be affirmative in the VSR construction which
disallows any NPI within it. Unlike Lee (2011), we claim that the verbs in the VSR can freely occur
either in the preceding position or in the following one regardless of their Neg value so long as
they share the same verbal suffix forms such as <em>-tun(ka)</em>. Furthermore, NPIs may occur within the VSR
construction if they occur with a negative predicate within the same clause. To implement the
findings above into HPSG, we have proposed the two lexical entries for mal-, the VSR Construction
Rule, and the NPI Clause-mate Constraint. These tools enable us to account for the idiosyncratic
properties of the VSR constructions under this constraint- and construction-based approach.  


Choi, Incheol # 0000-0002-5344-9085 # Kyungpook National University # Sentential specifiers in the Korean clause structure # 2012-10-11 # #
The Korean double nominative construction exhibits various properties distinguished not only from
ordinary subject-object clauses but also from nominative complement constructions. Particularly, the
second NP, not the initial NP, triggers the honorific agreement with the verb. I argue that the
first NP of the construction is identified as a sentential specifier which exists in addition to the
subject (cf. Major subject in Yoon 2004). The sentential specifier can be justified as the
characteristic of the topic-prominent language in the sense of Li and Thompson (1976). Specifically
I claim that any elements that satisfy the aboutness condition can be the sentential
specifier. Finally, I show that HPSG's valence value and an optional lexical rule provides an
elegant treatment of the construction; SPR list in a sentence level can be utilized for the
sentential specifier (cf. Kim et al. 2007). 

Costa, Francisco & Branco, António # mailed & 0000-0002-7174-4942 # University of Lisbon # Backshift and tense decomposition # 2012-10-15 # #
Backshift is a phenomenon affecting verb tense that is visible as a mismatch
between some specific embedded contexts and other environments.  For instance,
the indirect speech equivalent of a sentence like 'Kim likes reading', with
a present tense verb, may show the same verb in a past tense form, as in 'Sandy said Kim liked
reading'.  We present a general analysis of backshift, pooling data from English and Romance
languages.  Our analysis acknowledges that tense morphology is ambiguous between different temporal
meanings, explicitly models the role of the speech time and the event times involved and takes the
aspectual constraints of tenses into consideration.

In this paper I explore the logical range of sentential negation types predicted by the theory of
HPSG. I find that typological surveys confirm that attested simple negation strategies neatly line
up with the types of lexical material given by assuming Lexical Integrity and standard Phrase
Structure Grammar dependencies. I then extend the methodology to bipartite negation and derive a
space of predicted sentential negation types. I present details of the analysis for each type and
relevant examples where possible.

Recent years have witnessed a renewal of interest in variable morph ordering, the situation where
the position of a morph in the word is not constant. These situations present a challenge to extant
inferential-realisational approaches to morphology (Stump, 2001), insofar as these adopt implicitly
or explicitly an a-morphous approach to morphological composition (Anderson, 1992). In this paper we
will first review the typology of known variable morph ordering phenomena in inflection. We then
argue that the challenges can be met by making a distinction between paradigmatic opposition classes
and syntagmatic position classes, and show that this distinction can readily be implemented in HPSG
while keeping the amorphous assumption. 


Hahn, Michael # 0000-0003-4828-4834 # University of Tübingen # Arabic relativization patterns:<br> A unified HPSG analysis # 2012-10-15 # #
Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic have several relativization patterns, including relative clauses with and without relativizers and adjectival modification patterns. Previous generative work has targeted several phenomena, but there is no analysis which covers all relativization patterns in any generative framework. We present an HPSG analysis that covers these phenomena in a uniform manner. Based on Doron and Reintges (2005), we show that the crosslinguistically unusual syntax of adjectival modifiers is a language-internally expected variant of participial modifiers as found in English. We also present the first HPSG analysis of Arabic broad subjects and argue that they are selected as specifiers, accounting for the similarities between broad subjects and ordinary subjects.

This paper presents an account of the position of sentence adverbials
in Norwegian within a left-branching HPSG-like grammar design. The
assumed left-branching structures open for a treatment of Object Shift
in Norwegian as part of a wider phenomenon referred to as the Adverb
Argument Intersection Field. The approach is compared to the standard
P&P analysis of Object Shift and it is shown that the two approaches
make similar predictions regarding basic clause structures with full
NP arguments. However, while one in P&P is forced to assume a
secondary phonological movement in order to account for the position
of unstressed pronoun objects with regard to sentence adverbials, no
extra assumptions need to be made in the proposed account.

This paper presents a left-branching constructionalist grammar design
where the phrase structure tree does not correspond to the
conventional constituent structure. The constituent structure is
rather reflected by embeddings on a feature STACK. The design is
compatible with incremental processing, as words are combined from
left to right, one by one, and it gives a simple account of long
distance dependencies, where the extracted element is assumed to be
dominated by the extraction site. It is motivated by psycholinguistic
findings.

Ionescu, Emil # 0000-0003-1270-1261 # University of Bucharest # A hybrid type of ellipsis in Romanian # 2012-10-14 # # 
The paper presents a type of ellipsis similar to stripping and split conjuncts, yet irreducible to
either of them. One aim of the analysis is to document the existence of this distinct ellipsis type
within the class of constructions where the elided constituent is a verb or a verb phrase. It is
argued that the main generative strategies, namely, deletion and null anaphora cannot be applied to
this ellipsis type in order to account for it. Instead, the study shows that an approach which takes
the asymmetry syntax-semantics of this construction as basic is much more successful in explaining
the nature of this type of ellipsis. This alternative approach is the one offered by the HPSG
framework.

This paper is intended to investigate the linguistic behaviors of the Korean <em>as</em>-parenthetical
constructions with the aim of devoting to distinguishing universal properties of
<em>as</em>-parentheticals. This paper shows three prominent behaviors in Korean <em>as</em>-parenthetical
constructions. First, the Korean <em>as</em>-clause displays that the syntactic gap in <em>as</em>-clauses must be
realized as CP, through the variations on case marker. Secondly, the Korean <em>as</em>-parentheticals tend
to have two types of <em>as</em>-clauses; CP or VP <em>as</em>-clause types. In addition, they are sensitive to the
syntactic restrictions which can be noticed in <em>as</em>-parenthetical constructions: the sisterhood
restriction and the Island boundary. Thirdly, the Korean <em>as</em>-parenthetical constructions reveal that
they would require some pragmatic information which is combined with semantic meaning, in the
process of getting the interpretation of <em>as</em>-clauses. 

Koga, Hiroki # mailed # Saga University # Past affix' selection of verbal stems # 2012-10-15 # #
We will observe which stem allomorph the affixes, the so-called `non-past' affix, the past affix,
the imperative affix, the negative affix and the voice affix-like verbs, select between the longer
and the shorter in Japanese-Yanagawa dialect on the assumption that verbal lexemes may be associated
with more than one stem. Observing the phenomenon more closely, we found that the verbal stem forms
entertain default implicative relations in the stem dependency hierarchy. We will propose i) an
implemented analysis of the past affix and ii) an implementation of the allomorph selections by the
`non-past' affix in Koga and Ono, 2010 as two examples. 

Lee, Juwon # 0000-0002-4216-0884 # University of Texas at Austin # The direct evidential <em>-te</em> in Korean:<br> Its interaction with person and experiencer predicates # 2012-10-18 #  #
This paper discusses the complex relations among the direct evidential <em>-te</em>, person, and experiencer
predicates in Korean. The questions of the paper are: (i) how the three components are related with
each other in the evidential sentences, and (ii) how the interactions of the three components can be
formally analyzed to correctly license only the well-formed evidential sentences. I show that in
direct evidential construction with a non-private predicate (e.g. <em>pwutulep-</em> ‘soft’), the
asserter/epistemic authority (i.e. the speaker <em>na</em> ‘I’ in declarative or the addressee <em>ne</em> ‘you’ in
question) must be the experiencer of the predicate, but there is no such constraint in direct
evidential construction with a private predicate (e.g. <em>aphu-</em> ‘sick’). I also show that the direct
evidential construction with a non-private predicate is an instance of self-ascription. Then I
propose an analysis of the experiencer predicates and associated lexical rules in the Minimal
Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake, et al., 2005) of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
(Pollard and Sag, 1994; Sag, et al., 2003).     

Lee, Yong-hun # mailed # Chungnam National University # A unified approach to VP-ellipsis and VP-anaphora # 2012-10-15 # #
It is known that VP-ellipsis and VP-anaphora are typologically different phenomena. English has
VP-ellipses whereas Korean has VP-anaphora. The goals of this paper are (i) to develop a unified
algorithm which can analyze these two different phenomena and (ii) to explain them using the
developed resolution algorithm. In order to analyze these phenomena, this paper incorporates
Jager's anaphora resolution mechanism (2010) into the typed feature structure formalism of
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). In this paper, VP-ellipsis and VP-anaphora are analyzed
as follows. First, English do and Korean kuleha-ta are introduced with the Geach value, and this
value is changed with a slash-elimination rule. Then, one constituent combines with another by
ordinary syntactic rules, while the information on the target predicate is percolated up. When a
potential source appears, a slash-introduction rule is applied. Then, the source predicate activates
the VP-resolution rule, and the target predicate is connected with the source in the semantic
representations. 


Maekawa, Takafumi # mailed # Hokusei Gakuen University Junior College # Negative inversion constructions in HPSG # 2012-10-15 # no #
The major analyses of the negative inversion (NI) constructions in the
Minimalist/Principles-and-Parameters theory claim that the initial negative expression occupies
[Spec,FocP]. In this paper, I argue that there is a body of data which are problematic for the
Minimalist/Principles-and-Parameters analyses but that HPSG can provide a fairly straightforward
account of the facts. The use of hierarchically organised network of clausal types allows us to
accommodate not just the construction-specific properties of NI sentences but also the regularities
that they share with other constructions with subject-auxiliary inversion.

The Japanese infinitive-clause construction (InfCx) and gerund-clause construction (GerCx), which
are the most basic subordination structures (considered as coordination structures by some) in the
language, may convey a wide range of interclausal semantic relations, including ‘temporal sequence’,
‘cause’, and ‘manner’, largely due to pragmatic enrichment. This work addresses the question of what
the core meaning(s) of the  two constructions is (are), and demonstrates (i) that the InfCx and GerCx 
indicate either that the first-clause eventuality precedes or temporally subsumes the second-clause
eventuality or that the two clauses stand in the  rhetorical relation of <em>contrast</em>, and (ii)
that the GerCx has a distinct sense that the InfCx lacks, which gives rise to the ‘resulting state’ interpretation.


Park, Dong-woo # mailed # Seoul National University # An HPSG approach to English comparative inversion # 2012-10-19 # # 
It has been analyzed that the word order of English comparative inversion is analogous to that of
other subject-auxiliary inversions in that only a finite auxiliary verb can be followed by the
subject. However, English comparative inversion should be distinguished from other inversions
because the subject can be located between a cluster of auxiliary verbs and the non-auxiliary verb
phrase in English comparative inversion. Existing analyses on subject-auxiliary inversion cannot
account for this special kind of inversion. This paper proposes a new phrase type for English
comparative inversion within the construction-based HPSG. In addition, I suggest that constraints on
properties of lexemes participating in the new phrase type are governed by the construction-based
approach, while the word order of English comparative inversion is determined by rules that the word
order domain approach adopts. Also, it will be shown that these proposals can capture the word order
of nor-inversion, as-inversion, and so-inversion as well as that of comparative inversion.

This paper, in the context of multilingual MT, proposes the use of ICONS
(Individual CONstraintS) to add a representation of information structure to
MRS. The value of ICONS is a list of objects of type info-str, each of which
has the features CLAUSE and TARGET. The subtypes of info-str indicate
which information structural role is played by the TARGET with respect
to the CLAUSE. This proposal is designed to support both the calculation
of focus projection from underspecified representations and the handling of
multiclausal sentences.


Van Eynde, Frank # 0000-0002-6172-442X # Centre for Computational Linguistics Department of Linguistics University of Leuven # On the agreement between predicative complements and their target # 2012-10-15 # #
Predicative complements canonically show number and/or gender agreement with their target. The most
detailed proposal on how to model it in HPSG is provided in Kathol (1999). This proposal, though,
chiefly deals with the predicative adjectives of the Romance languages, and turns out to be
inappropriate for dealing with predicate nominals. There is an obvious way to repair it, but it
cannot be fitted in the canonical HPSG treatment of clauses with a predicative complement. It can be
fitted, though, in a treatment of such clauses that was proposed in Van Eynde (2009).  Adopting that
treatment, the agreement is modeled in terms of a constraint on the lexemes which select a
predicative complement.
