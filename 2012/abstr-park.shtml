</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
It has been analyzed that the word order of English comparative inversion is analogous to that of
other subject-auxiliary inversions in that only a finite auxiliary verb can be followed by the
subject. However, English comparative inversion should be distinguished from other inversions
because the subject can be located between a cluster of auxiliary verbs and the non-auxiliary verb
phrase in English comparative inversion. Existing analyses on subject-auxiliary inversion cannot
account for this special kind of inversion. This paper proposes a new phrase type for English
comparative inversion within the construction-based HPSG. In addition, I suggest that constraints on
properties of lexemes participating in the new phrase type are governed by the construction-based
approach, while the word order of English comparative inversion is determined by rules that the word
order domain approach adopts. Also, it will be shown that these proposals can capture the word order
of nor-inversion, as-inversion, and so-inversion as well as that of comparative inversion.
