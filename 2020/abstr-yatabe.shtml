<p>
In this paper, I point out that all available analyses of the so-called internal readings of sentences like "The students saw different films" have some empirical flaws, and propose a novel HPSG-based theory of such readings that is based on the idea that the internal readings of such sentences arise when a symmetrical predicate like "different" has an implicit argument whose meaning involves that of a reciprocal pronoun. In the course of formulating the theory, I also present a new analysis of the semantics of reciprocal pronouns, which is shown to be an improvement over previous analyses like that proposed in Heim, Lasnik, and May's 1991 paper.
