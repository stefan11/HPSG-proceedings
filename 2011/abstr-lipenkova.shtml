</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
The paper aims at a formulation of semantic constraints on the produc-
tivity of the Chinese <em>ba</em>-construction and their representation at the
syntax-semantics interface. It builds on the observation that requirements
on the surface form of the construction may be altered by the choice of
the verb. I propose that the semantics of the <em>ba</em>-construction can be
treated in terms of a scalar constraint: a <em>ba</em>-sentence must come with a
scale and a difference value that holds of the described event. The
satisfaction of this constraint largely relies on the lexical semantics of
the sentence. Not all verbs are inherently associated with scalar
relations; those that are not must combine with an additional dependent
which satisfies the scale requirement. Due to the obligatory presence of
the additional dependent for some verbs, it is reanalyzed as a complement
of <em>ba</em>: being optional on their level of combination with the verb, it
becomes obligatory once the verb is used in the <em>ba</em>-construction.
