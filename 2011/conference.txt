The use of hand gestures to point at objects and individuals, or to navigate through landmarks on a
virtually created map is ubiquitous in face-to-face conversation. We take this observation as a
starting point, and we demonstrate that deictic gestures can be analysed on a par with speech by
using standard methods from constraint-based grammars such as HPSG. In particular, we use the form
of the deictic signal, the form of the speech signal (including its prosodic marking) and their
relative temporal performance to derive an integrated multimodal tree that maps to an integrated
multimodal meaning. The integration process is constrained via construction rules that rule out
ill-formed input. These rules are driven from an empirical corporal study which sheds light on the
interaction between speech and deictic gesture.

This paper examines the apparently odd location of case-marking
formatives found in the Pacific Northwest language, Coast Tsimshian.
It first argues that the case-marking formatives are actually affixes
on the preceding words, not prosodically-dependent words. Given this
morphological analysis, a syntactic analysis is proposed that utilizes
the  'informationally-rich' syntactic structure of HPSG. In
particular, the analysis proposed uses EDGE features and chained
identities between adjacent phrasal sisters to license the clause.
This enables a simple analysis of  the clausal syntax of Coast
Tsimshian while still accounting for the wide array of facts
surrounding the connectives.

We explore the interaction of sentential negation and word order in Basque using a small
experimental implemented grammar based on the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002, 2010) to test the
analyses. We find that the analysis of free word order (Fokkens, 2010) provided by the Grammar
Matrix customization system can be adapted to handle the Basque facts, and that the constructional
approach taken in that analysis supports the integration of negation.

Hahn, Michael # # University of Tübingen # Null conjuncts and bound pronouns in Arabic # 2011-11-15 # #
This paper presents a descriptive overview and a formal analysis of the
syntax of pronominal arguments, pronominal conjuncts and bound pronouns
in Arabic. I argue that Arabic allows first conjuncts to be null and that this
is an instance of a more general pattern of zero anaphora that may affect
pronominal arguments or their first conjuncts. First Conjunct Agreement
and constraints on the distribution of zero anaphora are accounted for by a
new feature sharing mechanism which allows a uniform treatment without
appeal to the internal structure of argument NPs. I then argue that Arabic
bound pronouns should be analyzed as affixes and present an analysis of
their relation to argument structure and coordination. Finally, it is shown how
constraints on case marking in Arabic coordination can be formalized. The
analysis is part of an Arabic grammar fragment implemented in the TRALE
system.

Hasegawa, Akio & Koenig, Jean-Pierre # & 0000-0002-5431-5978 # University at Buffalo # Focus particles, secondary meanings, and Lexical Resource Semantics:<br> The case of Japanese <em>shika</em> # 2011-11-16 # # 
Japanese has two exclusive particles `shika' and `dake'. Although traditionally, both particles were
considered to be exclusive particles like `only', a recent proposal claims that `shika' is an
exceptive particle like `everyone except' to account for the necessary co-occurrence of the negative
suffix `na' and `shika'. We show that this negative suffix lacks two critical semantic properties of
ordinary logical negation: It is not downward entailing, nor does it license negative polarity
items. We show that both `shika' and `dake' are exclusive particles, but that `shika' encodes an
additional secondary meaning. The negative suffix only contributes to the sentence's secondary
meaning when it co-occurs with `shika'. We present an HPSG and LRS analysis that models the
co-occurrence of `shika' and the negative suffix `na', and their contribution to the sentence's
secondary meaning.

English Binominal NPs (BNP) (e.g., a hell of a problem) are of empirical and
theoretical interest due to their complex syntactic and semantic properties. In
this paper, we review some basic properties of the BNP construction, focusing
on its headedness, semantic relations, and the role of the preposition of.
We argue that these properties suggest an account in the spirit of construction
grammar. In particular, we show that English BNP is a nominal juxtaposition
construction whose special syntactic constraints are linked to semantic
relations like a subject-predicate relation.

Krieger, Hans-Ulrich & Kiefer, Bernd # & # DFKI, Saarbrücken # Converting CCGs into typed feature structure grammars # 2011-11-11 # #
In this paper, we report on a transformation scheme that turns a Categorial
Grammar, more specifically, a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; see
Baldridge, 2002) into a derivation- and meaning-preserving typed feature
structure (TFS) grammar.
<p>
We describe the main idea which can be traced back at least to work by
Karttunen (1986), Uszkoreit (1986), Bouma (1988), and Calder et al. (1988).
We then show how a typed representation of complex categories can be extended
by other constraints, such as modes, and indicate how the Lambda semantics of
combinators is mapped into a TFS representation, using unification to perform
perform alpha-conversion and beta-reduction (Barendregt, 1984).
We also present first findings concerning runtime measurements, showing
that the PET system, originally developed for the HPSG grammar framework,
outperforms the OpenCCG parser by a factor of 8&ndash;10 in the time domain and a
factor of 4&ndash;5 in the space domain.

Levine, Robert # # Ohio State University # Linearization and its discontents # 2011-11-21 # #
Much recent work on coordination in the HPSG
framework seeks to deal with some of the most intractable issues this
phenomenon poses for a constraint-based phrase structure architecture
by appealing to the linearization mechanism introduced in
Reape 1993. The research in question utilizes the mismatch between
linear phonological sequences on the one hand and phrasal
configuration on the other to underwrite a particular interpretation
of ellipsis in which multiple structural objects with identical or
near-identical descriptions are mapped to a single {\it dom-object}
token. This mapping apparently allows a variety of problematic cases,
such as right node raising, dependent cluster coordination, and unlike
category coordination to be reinterpreted as instances of ordinary
coordination in which structurally present elements receive no
prosodic expression, creating the impression that strings which do not
correspond to constituents of the same category have nonetheless been
conjoined or disjoined. I argue in this paper that such
linearization-based ellipsis (LBE) analyses, though plausible when
confined to a narrow class of simplest-case data, prove untenable in
the face of data sets in which the LBE approach must account for the
interaction of nonconstituent coordination and quantification or
symmetric predication, symmetrical modification of nominal heads, and
a large and varied class of unlike category coordinations that do not
admit of any ellipsis-based solutions. I show in addition that various
objections offered in the LBE literature to categorial grammar
treatments of the problems posed by noncanonical coordinations do not
take into account techical resources available to CG which permit
straightforward and unproblematic solutions to these problems. One
must conclude that despite the general poplularity of LBE accounts of
conjunction, there is at the moment no satisfactory HPSG treatment of
noncanonical coordinations.

Lipenkova, Janna # 0000-0003-4093-170X # Freie Universität Berlin # Reanalysis of semantically required dependents as complements in the Chinese <em>ba</em>-construction # 2011-11-15 # #
The paper aims at a formulation of semantic constraints on the produc-
tivity of the Chinese <em>ba</em>-construction and their representation at the
syntax-semantics interface. It builds on the observation that requirements
on the surface form of the construction may be altered by the choice of
the verb. I propose that the semantics of the <em>ba</em>-construction can be
treated in terms of a scalar constraint: a <em>ba</em>-sentence must come with a
scale and a difference value that holds of the described event. The
satisfaction of this constraint largely relies on the lexical semantics of
the sentence. Not all verbs are inherently associated with scalar
relations; those that are not must combine with an additional dependent
which satisfies the scale requirement. Due to the obligatory presence of
the additional dependent for some verbs, it is reanalyzed as a complement
of <em>ba</em>: being optional on their level of combination with the verb, it
becomes obligatory once the verb is used in the <em>ba</em>-construction.

Müller, Stefan & Ørsnes, Bjarne # 0000-0003-4413-5313 & 0000-0003-2046-2029 # Freie Universität Berlin # Positional expletives in Danish, German, and Yiddish # 2011-11-04 # #
This paper deals with expletives that are inserted into clauses for structural reasons. We will
focus on the Germanic languages Danish, German, and Yiddish. In Danish and Yiddish expletives are
inserted in preverbal position in certain <em>wh</em>-clauses: In Danish such an insertion is
observed when the subject is locally extracted from an SVO configuration in non-assertive
clauses. In Yiddish <em>wh</em>-clauses are formed from a <em>wh</em>-phrase and a V2 clause. If no
element would be fronted in the embedded V2 clause, an expletive is inserted in non-assertive
clauses in order to meet the V3 requirement for embedded clauses. In
addition to embedded <em>wh</em>-clauses,
declarative V2 clauses also allow the insertion of an expletive. In Danish the expletive fills the
subject position and is not necessarily fronted. In German and Yiddish the expletive has to occur in
fronted position. In contrast to Danish and Yiddish, German does not
insert expletives into embedded <em>wh</em>-clauses. They are
inserted only into declarative V2 clauses in order to fulfill the V2 requirement without having to
front another constituent. In this paper we try to provide an account that captures the
commonalities between the three languages while being able to account for the differences.

Sluicing is widely regarded as requiring an analysis via deletion
operations, a potentially problematic conclusion for
non-transformational frameworks like \HPSG. We examine critically and
reassess the motivation for a deletion analysis of Sluicing, offering
cross-linguistic and language-internal evidence in support of a
fundamentally semantic constructional alternative like the
one proposed by Ginzburg and Sag (2000).

This paper examines the morpho-syntactic puzzle of case suffixes and postpositions that Hungarian
displays. Although these two categories show distributional similarities, they are distinguishable
from a morphological and a syntactic point of view. Moreover, this language has defective
postpositions which are in complementary distribution with case suffixes. I argue that there is no
real argument for lumping case suffixes together with postpositions into the same syntactic
category, as has been suggested in recent linguistics studies (Trommer, 2008; Asbury, 2007).  I
rather propose to treat case suffixes and postpositions as two different objects: case suffixes are
inflectional material on nominal heads and postpositions as well as defective postpositions are
independent words subcategorizing an NP. This distinction straightforwardly accounts for
morphological and syntactic differences. Finally, the shared distributional properties between case
suffixes, postpositions and defective postpositions are captured by means of the use of the MARKING
feature.

Walker, Heike # # University of Frankfurt am Main # Adjuncts and the HPSG binding theory # 2011-11-15 # #
The HPSG binding theory in Pollard and Sag (1994) cannot account for the binding-theoretic
interaction between main clause and adjunct-internal elements. Following Hukari and Levine (1995), I
claim that structural configurations must be taken into account. In this article, I present a
revised version of Hukari and Levine's configurational relation called v(alence-based)-c-command and
propose that Principle C must involve this relation in addition to the obliqueness-based relation of
o-command. New data are provided that strongly support the proposed revision of the HPSG binding
theory. Finally, I argue that Principle C is syntactic rather than pragmatic in nature.

Wasow, Thomas & Clausen, David # & # Stanford University # Weak cross-over and informativity # 2011-11-15 # no #
Wasow (1972) introduced the distinction between weak and strong
cross-over, illustrated in (1) because examples like (1a) seem
possible in appropriate contexts, whereas the indicated coreference in
(1b) is totally impossible.  
<pre>  
(1) a.  ??Who<sub>i</sub> did you talk to the boy she<sub>i</sub> liked about?  
    b.  *I know who<sub>i</sub> Charlie think he<sub>i</sub> hurt.
</pre>
Following a suggestion of Culicover's, Wasow proposed that the gaps in
long-distance dependencies contain traces coindexed with the fillers.
Under this analysis, the low acceptability of an example like (1a) is
related to the low acceptability of cataphora with indefinite
antecedents: 
<pre>
(2) ??I talked to the boy she<sub>i</sub> liked about a girl<sub>i</sub>.
</pre>
Work by Hofmeister, Sag, Clausen and others has shown that at least
some island phenomena can be explained in terms of factors that cause
processing difficulty.  They have shown that the graded nature and
context sensitivity of many island phenomena are better explained in
terms of demands on memory during processing than through appeals to
universal grammatical constraints.
This talk explored the possibility of explaining weak-crossover (WCO)
in similar terms.  It reported on three studies in which participants
identified the referent of a pronoun and then rated sentences on a
seven-point Likert scale.  The test sentences were embedded in a
context designed to favor the intended interpretation of the pronoun.
Each study contained examples with short (uninformative) antecedents
for the pronoun as well as examples with longer (informative)
antecedents.  The three studies investigated WCO in questions, WCO in
relative clauses, and cataphora.  Each study also contained controls
without the phenomenon under study, as well as both grammatical and
ungrammatical fillers.  Sample stimuli are given in (3)-(5).
<pre>
(3) WCO in Questions: 
The hiring committee was presented with only a subset of the
applicants. Some had been eliminated because their files were
incomplete, but the committee chair dropped one applicant because of
negative comments from colleagues who knew that applicant well.  THE
REST OF THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT TOLD WHO/WHICH JOB APPLICANT PEOPLE THAT
KNEW HIM WELL HAD CRITICIZED
</pre>
<pre>
(4) WCO in Relative Clauses
In the bottom of the fourth inning, a questionable call elicited jeers
from the visitors' dugout. One of the umpires evidently heard
something sufficiently offensive to stick his head into the dugout and
issue a warning.  THE RADIO ANNOUNCER COULDN'T SEE THE PERSON/VISITING
PLAYER WHO THE UMPIRE HE HAD OFFENDED HAD WARNED.
</pre>
<pre>
(5) Cataphora
The news media are already beginning to cover the race for the 2012
Republican presidential nomination.  At a recent convention of GOP
bigwigs, many potential candidates were soliciting endorsements.
EVERYONE HE SOLICITED HAD PURPORTEDLY AGREED TO ENDORSE ONE
PERSON/POTENTIAL CANDIDATE
</pre>
Our expectations of these experiments included the following: 
<ul>
<li> In all three studies, we expected the controls (non-WCO or anaphora)
  to be judged better than the test sentences (WCO or cataphora).
<li> In all studies, we expected informative antecedents to be judged
  better than the uninformative antecedents.
<li> We expected WCOs to be judged better than the ungrammatical fillers.
<li> We expected the embedded question WCOs to be judged worse than the
  relative clause WCOs.
<li> We expected the cataphora examples to be judged better than the
  WCOs.
</ul>
Our studies collected 1111 ratings of embedded question WCOs, 1447
relative clause WCOs, and 1220 ratings of cataphora examples, from a
total 361 participants.  The results confirmed some of our
expectations but not others.  Specifically:
<ul>
<li> As expected the controls (non-WCO or anaphora) were judged better
    than the test sentences (WCO or cataphora).
<li> As expected, informative antecedents were generally judged better
    than the uninformative antecedents, but not in embedded question
    WCOs or in RC controls. This difference is a mystery to us.
<li> Contrary to our expectations, the embedded question WCOs were judged
    slightly better than the relative clause WCOs.
<li> As expected, the cataphora examples were judged better than the
    WCOs.
<li> Even informative WCOs received low acceptability scores, but were
    rated higher than ungrammatical fillers.
</ul>
We tentatively concluded that processing factors play a role in the
low acceptability of WCO.  In particular:
<ul>
<li> The processing cost of filler-gap dependencies makes WCO hard.
<li> The processing cost of establishing pronoun-antecedent pairings
   makes WCO hard.
<li> WCO involves the same extra processing cost as cataphora.
<li> Informative antecedents mitigate the processing costs, at least
   sometimes.
<li> Whether the cumulative processing costs are sufficient to account
   for the low acceptability of WCO examples remains unclear.
</ul>
The question of whether weak cross-over effects can be fully explained
in terms of constraints on processing remains unresolved but deserves
further study.

Verb second (V2) word order is determined by considering the absolute position of clausal
constituents.  Previous accounts of such word order in HPSG have been developed for individual V2
languages (predominantly German) but are often not cross-linguistically applicable.  I propose a
set of generalized mechanisms in linearization-based SBCG which accounts for cross-linguistic V2
data by use of: (1) a simple two-valued feature rather than many-typed topological domains, (2)
domain compaction, and (3) constructionally-determined domain positions.  Not only does this
analysis account for V2 placement, but it can also model verb third (V3) placement and other
positionally-stipulated word orders.
