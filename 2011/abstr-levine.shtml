<p>
Much recent work on coordination in the HPSG
framework seeks to deal with some of the most intractable issues this
phenomenon poses for a constraint-based phrase structure architecture
by appealing to the linearization mechanism introduced in
Reape 1993. The research in question utilizes the mismatch between
linear phonological sequences on the one hand and phrasal
configuration on the other to underwrite a particular interpretation
of ellipsis in which multiple structural objects with identical or
near-identical descriptions are mapped to a single {\it dom-object}
token. This mapping apparently allows a variety of problematic cases,
such as right node raising, dependent cluster coordination, and unlike
category coordination to be reinterpreted as instances of ordinary
coordination in which structurally present elements receive no
prosodic expression, creating the impression that strings which do not
correspond to constituents of the same category have nonetheless been
conjoined or disjoined. I argue in this paper that such
linearization-based ellipsis (LBE) analyses, though plausible when
confined to a narrow class of simplest-case data, prove untenable in
the face of data sets in which the LBE approach must account for the
interaction of nonconstituent coordination and quantification or
symmetric predication, symmetrical modification of nominal heads, and
a large and varied class of unlike category coordinations that do not
admit of any ellipsis-based solutions. I show in addition that various
objections offered in the LBE literature to categorial grammar
treatments of the problems posed by noncanonical coordinations do not
take into account techical resources available to CG which permit
straightforward and unproblematic solutions to these problems. One
must conclude that despite the general poplularity of LBE accounts of
conjunction, there is at the moment no satisfactory HPSG treatment of
noncanonical coordinations.
