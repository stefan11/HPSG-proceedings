</h1>

<div class="blurb"
<p>
In this paper, I investigate the syntax-discourse interface in Hungarian and propose the first steps
of its formalization in the framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar. Concerning the syntax, I
propose a flat structure in Hungarian, in which the preverbal domain is determined by the
information structure. I examine the distribution of elements in the topic field and the Prominent
Preverbal Position (PPP), and point out that they can be filled differently depending on the
discourse context of the utterance. I also observe that the information structure used in the
mainstream LFG literature is not general enough to accommodate two important discourse functions:
the contrastive topic and the hocus. This is why a new architecture is put forth, building on the
common features and not the discourse functions themselves, that can account for the Hungarian data
more adequately. The syntax-discourse interface is then exposed via the mappings between the
constituent and information structures.
