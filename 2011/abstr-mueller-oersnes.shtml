<p>
This paper deals with expletives that are inserted into clauses for structural reasons. We will
focus on the Germanic languages Danish, German, and Yiddish. In Danish and Yiddish expletives are
inserted in preverbal position in certain <em>wh</em>-clauses: In Danish such an insertion is
observed when the subject is locally extracted from an SVO configuration in non-assertive
clauses. In Yiddish <em>wh</em>-clauses are formed from a <em>wh</em>-phrase and a V2 clause. If no
element would be fronted in the embedded V2 clause, an expletive is inserted in non-assertive
clauses in order to meet the V3 requirement for embedded clauses. In
addition to embedded <em>wh</em>-clauses,
declarative V2 clauses also allow the insertion of an expletive. In Danish the expletive fills the
subject position and is not necessarily fronted. In German and Yiddish the expletive has to occur in
fronted position. In contrast to Danish and Yiddish, German does not
insert expletives into embedded <em>wh</em>-clauses. They are
inserted only into declarative V2 clauses in order to fulfill the V2 requirement without having to
front another constituent. In this paper we try to provide an account that captures the
commonalities between the three languages while being able to account for the differences.
