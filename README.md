# HPSG-proceedings
This directory contains a script generating XML files for OJS import. It also contains all the HPSG proceedings raw files since 2001. The PDFs (from 2003 onwards) are used by the script to compile the standalone papers with title page and the XML file including these papers and one complete volume.

In addition, you will finde the guidelines for authors and an example file at the toplevel directory.
