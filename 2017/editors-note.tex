As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.

The proceedings include all the papers except the one by Justin Bai,  Maksymilian Dąbkowski, Kalinda
Pride,  and Nicholas Tomlin.
