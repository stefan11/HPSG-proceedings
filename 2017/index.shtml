We want to thank the program committees for putting this nice program together.
<p>
Thanks go to Fabiola Henri, who was
in charge of local arrangements, and her assistants.
<p>
<p>
As in the past years the contributions to the conference proceedings are based on the five page abstract
that was reviewed by the respective program committees, but there is no additional reviewing of the
longer contribution to the proceedings.
To ensure easy access and fast publication we have chosen an electronic format.
<p>
The proceedings include all the papers except the one by Justin Bai,  Maksymilian Dąbkowski, Kalinda
Pride,  and Nicholas Tomlin. 
<p>
<p>
<p>

The <a href="toc.shtml">table of contents</a> lists all the
papers presented at the conference. Some papers were not submitted to
the proceedings. For these papers, we suggest contacting the authors
directly.
